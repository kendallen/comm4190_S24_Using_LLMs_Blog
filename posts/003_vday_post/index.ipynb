    "\n",
    "In the spirit of the day characterized by cherubs, candy, and couples, I wanted to ask LLMs for cute ideas to use for children's cards this Valentine's Day. While I thought my question was rather straightforward, I was surprised (as I'm sure I often will be through this blog) to see drastically different responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Goal\n",
    "\n",

While I always associate cards with some kind of one-liner-- especially on holidays such as VDay-- I came to find out that some chatbots might need slightly more specific instructions than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt I used for every case was: \n",
