    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing a couple of blog posts testing out Suno-- a generative AI platform that generates music of all kinds-- I was excited to hear about the launch of its new competitor on April 10th: Udio. Though I accidentally almost signed up for the platform on a fake phishing website, once I navigated to the actual platform I knew I had to compare it to Suno, given their matching functions, similar capabilities, and nearly-identical UI designs. (Even the names feel like they mimick one another!) Below is what I found! "

    "## Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "To best pit these Udio and Suno against one another, I decided to give them three different prompts, focusing on contemporary rap, classic pop ballads, and a curveball-- yodeling. I believed that this range of tasks would allow for each platform to show off their abilities even if they produced vastly different works. "

    "## Observations \n",
    "\n",
    "Right off the bat I'm noticing some immediate differences: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Where Suno produces two songs with the same title and lyrics, Udio creates two different titles and sets of lyrics entirely\n",
    "- Where Suno creates two similar yet differentiated album covers, Udio uses a generic template for the art that is seemingly unrelated to the song it creates\n",
    "- Udio's \"Love in Cold Ink\" fully has sections with lyrics that are/sound like gibberish despite having written clear lyrics in its description. Additionally, the vocals on this track remind me a lot of Nicki Minaj's tone quality which is interesting\n",
    "- Udio's \"Spiraling Silence\" also sounded a lot like a real song called \"Escapism\" by RAYE, so I'm noticing that this platform tends to produce music more acutely similar to existing songs\n",
    "- Udio did a really solid job at following the prompt, while Suno had one very accurate execution of the genre (link #1) and one that missed the mark\n",
    "- Neither platform's lyricism was objectively better than the other's on this iteration\n",

    "- In this test, Suno took the prompt in a weird direction, using actual parts of my phrasing in the lyrics; most notably \"slow tempo\" and \"tears to my eyes.\" Odd choice.\n",
    "- Despite Suno's slightly weird lyrical take, I think the melody and feel of it's songs outdid Udio's execution on this prompt\n",
    "- Udio went a lot more rock than pop in \"Adrift Alone,\" and had pretty weak lyrics\n",
    "- Udio's \"Eternal Echoes\" was a more appropriate response, but once again fell short with its rather vague, non-descript lyrics\n",

    "After comparing and contrasting Suno and Udio, I have to say that I don't think there is a clear winner! Both won in lyrics in different prompt iterations and failed in others, and where Suno makes just one song title/set of lyrics, Udio makes only two kinds of album art, so there is a range of pros and cons for each platform. As noted in previous blog posts, though, I think that music-generative AI as a concept has a far way to go until it can match human creation, but it definitely can be used as a tool for brainstorming at this point. All in all, I had a wonderful time seeing what each platform had to offer, and look forward to seeing how they evolve down the road!"
