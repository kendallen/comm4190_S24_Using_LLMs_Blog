    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to another blog post about LLaVA! As mentioned in post #13, I was really fascinated by the platform's ability to interpret my facial expressions, and noticed its use of she/her pronouns for my images. I then asked it to describe my race, which it refused to do. Thus, I wondered what visible identities the program felt comfortable assuming, and was drawn to do further prompting on the topic of gender, sex, and pronoun usage. Below is what I encountered!"

    "## Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I noted that LLaVA assumed my pronouns, I wanted to approach this exploration by offering it a range of gender presentations to she how it identified different people. I want to acknowledge that this process did force me to adhere to very stereotypical gender norms/standards in order to get a full \"range\" of the spectrum, but by no means do I believe that how a person dresses, cuts their hair, does their makeup, etc is directly correlated to their identity. This was solely to see if LLaVA subscribed to that school of thought. I also wanted to prompt about assume gender expression, but note that I am not trying to conflate sex/gender. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, to make this blog post even more AI-focused, I asked Dalle-3 to generate the images I offered to LLaVA! I used the prompting template \"generate an image of a ___-looking ___\" (filled in by the headings below) and selected the first option it offered. "

The person's skin tone is fair, and there are visible wrinkles and lines on the face, suggesting middle to older age. The lighting in the photograph is soft and even, highlighting the contours of the face without creating harsh shadows. The background is a neutral, light color, which helps to keep the focus on the person. The image has a professional quality, likely taken in a studio setting."

    "Okay, interesting! So the language shifted on this one to \"appears to be.\" This is likely because the person fits the stereotypes less, having cropped hair and neutral colors on. The most shocking change, though, is the way that LLaVA used gender-neutral pronouns for the image, despite describing the person as a woman. This shows that when the program sees less gender-normative, identifying markers for a person, it switches to neutral language to account for its more vague understanding. \n",

    "Honestly I was surprised at the image Dalle-3 generated for this prompt, although that is really another conversation entirely. (I think there is something to be said about an Asian man being generated for the feminine prompt, but I digress.) We returned to the gender-neutral language, likely because of the inclusion of the long eyelashes in contrast with the stubble on the persons face. They seem to explicitly straddle male-female norms, so I understand why LLaVA reverted back to they/them pronouns. It appears to officially be an overarching pattern that when the program is mildly unsure about a person's gender, despite labeling them one way or the other. I think if I submitted an even more androgynous person, though, it might've been unable to answer the gender of the non-binary person. I'll circle back to that!\n",
