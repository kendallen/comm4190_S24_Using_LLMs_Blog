    "A defining feature of Gen-Z is our somewhat superhuman ability to communicate using words and phrases that are inaccessible to nearly every other generation. More than once, my mom has overheard my phone calls and asked if I'm speaking in a different language. Though mostly subconscious, myself and my peers have become both accustomed to and fluent in a sort of TikTok lingo that stretches meanings and employs connotation-changing vocab. \n",

    "\n",
    "1) The chatbot understood the positive connotations and informal definitions of the key words \"slay,\" \"giving,\" \"serving,\" and \"cunt.\" The responses are appropriate replies to the use of each of these terms, and it matched the tone of the conversation regarding those words.\n",
    "2) It didn't quite keep the energy of the conversation in its formal response to the query blue or pink; a person using this intonation would likely not make two numbered lists offering the benefits of each option... this felt much more like an AI speaker. \n",
    "3) Similarly to #2, it didn't match the energy in it's first repsonse to \"slay,\" because while the nature of the answer was correct, its formality didn't feel right. "

    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1) In using these terms/tone, Chat-GPT thought I was gay! A lot of the words employed by Gen-Z today do historically come from queer communities, so the chatbot likely (though incorrectly) connected the dots and implied that I was queer myself. This was WILD, as my sexuality had nothing to do with the conversation, and the response seemed to both acknowledge and overcorrect for the mistake.\n",
    "2) I'm shocked that Chat-GPT let its assumptions about me slip-- I don't think it would include an emoji of a person of color, in a Hijab, etc if it felt that statistically the speaker was leaning that direction.\n",
    "3) It also reveals that it is a pro-LGBT chatbot given its encouragement for me to \"shine, no labels attached!\" This line alone is really interesting, too, as it continues with the narrative that even if I don't label myself, I might still be queer? "
