    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In preparing for our final project-- an AI agent focused on offering investment advice to college students-- Emmy and I discovered a cutting-edge portfolio management AI platform called Magnifi. Denoted by many as the cross between ChatGPT and Robinhood (a modern buy/sell tool promoted to younger clientele), Magnifi is one of the first investing platforms that uses ChatGPT and computer programs to provide personalized, data-driven investment advice. While this blog post doesn't have an exact hypothesis, it will document some of my time playing around with this fascinating tool! Enjoy my testing. "

    "## Observations \n",
    "\n",
    "Just in this initial, somewhat surface-level testing, I noticed a lot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Magnifi is a full financial website, not just prompt-and-response agent. The AI assitant was just one of many features on the website\n",
    "- The platform uses Plaid, a company that allows fintech services to securely connect to user's 3rd-party accounts. I was honestly initially nervous about the pressure it was putting on me to link my accounts, but I ended up putting in my Vanguard information to see how personalized it could be \n",
    "- The AI functionality had some visible flaws as a basic level. It was hard for me to click the entry bar just to type a question (something was definitely faulty on the backend), and there was noticeably incorrect grammar\n",
    "- It seems like the AI assistant runs mostly off of suggested, basic questions. Any time I asked something, it would direct me to ask the pre-loaded questions rather than continue with my own line of reasoning\n",
    "- The platform was really user friendly, but lacked the depth/surety I expected from it. It asked me really easy-to-answer questions when I engaged with the retirement prompt, but then offered no timeline, tips, or ease for the portfolio development beyond being able to add the stocks to my cart via its purchase function\n",
    "- Overall, it just felt like Magnifi was made for people who already have a background in investing, know what they are doing, and just want to check specific stats or look at certain goals for which they are already planning. While the platform offers a lot for that demographic, I hope Emmy and I are able to work on creating something a bit more entry-level! Really enjoyed getting to try it out, though.\n",
