    "My name is Kendall and I am a third-year student at the University of Pennsylvania who just came back from a semester abroad in London! At Penn, I study Data & Network Science Communications, Spanish, and Consumer Psychology. Outside of the classroom, I am a Junior Captain of the Quaker Girls Dance Team, a Kite and Key Tour Guide, a member of the Wharton Women Marketing Committee, on the Executive Board of my sorority, and I do research at the Annenberg Health and Risk Communication Institute. I love to travel, see live performances, and play all of the NYT Mini Games (Letterboxed especially) in my free time."

From Valentine's Day to Gen-Z slang, I will ask many different LLMs about different prompts to see how they react and deepen my understanding of the programs. I hope you enjoy following along :)"
