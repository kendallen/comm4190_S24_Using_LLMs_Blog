<h1>Gender as an Implicit Linguistic Association</h1>
<p>In recent years, the public discourse surrounding gender vs.&nbsp;sex has become increasingly prevalent, with many people calling for an elimination of gender norms starting in childhood. From the decline of gender reveal parties to the encouragement of parents to buy their children <em>both</em> dolls and trucks, people are changing their attitudes about gender and the stereotypical associations we consciously or subconsciously make around it. Still, it remains easy and socially acceptable to ask little girls about what dolls they like or ask teenage boys if they watched last night’s NBA game, indicating that our gender associations run deep in our linguistic corpus. Given this background, I thought it would be interesting to see if ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) addressed me differently if I told it I was a boy or girl. For this exercise, I didn’t ask it to address me as a non-binary person for each prompt, I think incorporating non-binary identities would be a great idea for a future notebook, but here I am focusing on the “typical” gender binary, being girls/women and boys/men.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is immediately clear that ChatGPT is leaning into gender norms given its use of “toy cars” as the example for the boy response. Since cookies are seemingly gender-neutral and were used for the girl, the platform could’ve easily reused cookies in its explanation but instead chose to “relate” to the young boy by mentioning a toy that would stereotypically be preferred by boys.</p></li>
<li><p>Another key difference between the girl and boy responses was the way in which ChatGPT tried to frame the topic of addition to each gender. For the boy, the platform used a “cool” example to get the kid to follow along, whereas it used the “yummy” and almost cute idea of cookies to appeal to the girl.</p></li>
<li><p>I was happy to see that the quality of the response was equal across the boy and girl responses; the girl was not spoken to in a patronizing way, and the boy did not receive a more cold or emotionless reply, as could be hypothesized when considering how men and women have been historically addressed.</p></li>

<p>Absolutely! So, you know how in math we often deal with numbers, right? Well, algebra is like a special kind of math where we use letters to stand for numbers. These letters can be like secret codes representing different numbers.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say we have an equation like this:</p>
<p>x + 5 = 10</p>
<p>Here, “x” is our mystery number. We want to figure out what number “x” stands for. So, what we do is try to isolate “x” by itself on one side of the equation.</p>
<p>To do that, we need to get rid of the 5 that’s with the “x”. But whatever we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other to keep it balanced. It’s like playing with a scale – if you add weight to one side, you have to add the same weight to the other side to keep it balanced.</p>
<p>So, if we want to get rid of the 5, we can do the opposite, which is subtracting 5 from both sides:</p>
<p>x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5</p>
<p>This simplifies to:</p>
<p>x = 5</p>
<p>Now we’ve figured it out! “x” is 5. So, in this equation, 5 plus 5 equals 10.</p>

<p>Algebra helps us solve puzzles and figure out unknown numbers by using rules and operations to manipulate equations until we find the answers. It’s like being a detective, but with numbers!</p>

<p>Sure thing! Imagine you’re playing a video game, and you have a character whose strength is represented by a number. Let’s call it “power level”. Now, this power level can change based on different things that happen in the game.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>In algebra, we use letters, like “x”, to represent this power level. So, instead of saying “my character’s power level is 10”, we say “my character’s power level is x”.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say your character gains some experience points (XP) and their power level goes up. We can represent this as an equation:</p>
<p>x + 5 = 15</p>
<p>Here, “x” represents your character’s original power level. The equation says that if you add 5 to your character’s power level, you’ll get 15. But we want to know what your character’s original power level was.</p>
<p>To figure it out, we need to do the opposite of adding 5, which is subtracting 5. But whatever we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other to keep it balanced, just like in a video game where you need to balance your character’s skills.</p>
<p>So, if we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:</p>
<p>x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5</p>
<p>This simplifies to:</p>
<p>x = 10</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, your character’s original power level, represented by “x”, is 10. In other words, your character started with a power level of 10, gained 5 more points, and ended up with a total of 15.</p>
<p>Algebra is like using math to solve puzzles and mysteries, just like figuring out how to level up your character in a game!</p>

<li><p>Here we see again another set of responses that caters more directly to the boy’s theoretical and assumed interest in video games. While the girls’ reply poses algebra as a fun detective game, it is not particularly gendered. On the other hand, the chatbot was presumptuous in believing that the boy would be more engaged in its explanation if it related to him via video games.</p></li>
<li><p>Weird how the boy response weaves the video game analogy throughout itself, whereas the girl has significantly less of that and is generally more boring. Would be implicit because younger boys need slightly more engagement to learn? What could be other explanations for this?</p></li>
<li><p>Once again it’s good that the level of explanation remains the same across both replies, with the algebraic examples being of similar difficulty in each.</p></li>

<p>Alright, let’s dive into calculus! Imagine you’re driving a car along a curvy road, and you want to know how fast you’re going at any given moment. Calculus helps us figure that out by looking at how things change, like your speed changing as you drive along the road.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">

<p>In calculus, we have two main ideas: derivatives and integrals.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Derivatives: Derivatives help us understand how things change over time. Let’s go back to your car. If you want to know your speed at a specific moment, you’d find the derivative of your distance traveled with respect to time. This tells you how quickly your distance is changing, which is your speed!</p></li>
<li><p>Integrals: Integrals are like the opposite of derivatives. Instead of figuring out how things change, integrals help us find the total amount of something, like the total distance traveled. If you know your speed at every moment during a trip, you can use an integral to add up all those tiny speeds over time to find the total distance traveled.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, in simple terms, calculus helps us understand and work with things that change, whether it’s the speed of a car on a winding road, the growth of plants in a garden, or even the way the stars move in the sky. It’s like peeking into the secrets of how the world works and using math to describe those changes!</p>

<p>Sure thing! Imagine you’re playing a video game, and your character is moving around. Calculus is like figuring out how fast your character is moving and how much ground they’ve covered.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Derivatives</strong>: Think of derivatives as the “speedometer” of calculus. When you’re playing your game, if you want to know how fast your character is moving at any moment, you look at the derivative. It tells you the rate at which things are changing. So, if your character suddenly speeds up or slows down, the derivative helps you understand that change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrals</strong>: Now, imagine you want to know how far your character has traveled during the game. Integrals come into play here. They’re like the “odometer” of calculus. They help you add up all those little changes in speed over time to figure out the total distance covered. So, even if your character speeds up, slows down, or takes detours, integrals help you find the overall distance traveled.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, in essence, calculus is like using math to understand motion and change in the game world. Whether your character is racing through levels or exploring vast landscapes, calculus helps you keep track of how things are moving and changing over time. It’s like having a superpower to analyze and predict what’s going to happen next in the game!</p>

<li><p><strong>Saving for the Future</strong>: A 401(k) is like a special account where you can save money for when you’re older and want to retire. Just like squirrels gather nuts for the winter, you’re putting away money now so you can enjoy it later when you’re not working anymore.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Money from Your Job</strong>: When you work for a company, you can choose to have a little bit of your paycheck put into your 401(k) every time you get paid. It’s like setting aside a portion of your treasure every time you find some.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Company Help</strong>: Sometimes, your company will even help you out by matching some of the money you put into your 401(k). It’s like having a buddy chip in some treasure for your adventure fund!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investing for Growth</strong>: The cool thing about your 401(k) treasure chest is that you can invest the money inside to make it grow. It’s like planting seeds in your garden - over time, they grow into big, strong trees that provide even more treasure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Retirement Adventure</strong>: When you’re finally ready to retire and go on your big adventure, you can start using the treasure you’ve saved in your 401(k) to live comfortably and do all the things you’ve always dreamed of doing.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, think of your 401(k) as your own personal treasure chest, helping you save up for an amazing adventure in the future. The more you contribute now, and the smarter you invest, the richer your retirement adventure will be!</p>

<li><p><strong>Long-Term Savings</strong>: Think of your 401(k) as your long-term savings plan. It’s like leveling up your character in a game - you’re investing in your future self to become stronger and more prepared for whatever challenges come your way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Contributions</strong>: When you sign up for a 401(k) through your job, you’re basically setting up automatic transfers from your paycheck into your retirement account. It’s like putting gold coins into your savings chest every time you defeat a monster in a game - you’re steadily building up your wealth over time without even thinking about it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employer Match</strong>: Now, here’s where the game gets really interesting. Some companies offer to match a portion of your contributions to your 401(k). It’s like having a powerful ally in your quest who’s willing to throw in some extra resources to help you succeed. You definitely want to take advantage of this perk because it’s essentially free money!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investment Choices</strong>: Inside your 401(k), you have different investment options, kind of like choosing which weapons or skills to upgrade in a game. You can invest in things like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, with the goal of growing your money over time. Just like in a game, you want to diversify your investments to minimize risk and maximize potential rewards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Retirement Victory</strong>: As you keep playing the game of life, your 401(k) grows through your contributions and investment gains. When you finally reach the endgame - retirement - you’ll have a substantial nest egg waiting for you. It’s like defeating the final boss and claiming your well-deserved victory!</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, think of your 401(k) as your ultimate retirement strategy - you’re building wealth, taking advantage of employer perks, and ultimately securing your financial victory for the future. It’s all about playing the long game and setting yourself up for success down the road.</p>

<li><p>Okay, this set of replies follows the gendered-boy and neutral-girl pattern, but the game analogy for the man is slightly less pronounced now, only being referred back to a couple of times.</p></li>
<li><p>The wording of the categories for the men seems a bit more technical than that for the women, and I noticed the difference between “Retirement Adventure” and “Retirement Victory” for the women and men respectively. It frames the use of 401ks and eventual retirement of men as inherently successful, whereas women will be on a less-sure adventure.</p></li>
<li><p>One other thing I noticed is the more straightforward tone that ChatGPT uses with the men. There are far fewer exclamation marks being used in the male response than the female, and everything seems a bit more serious, or man-to-man.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Gathering Place</strong>: Just like the town square or the local church hall used to be the heart of the community, social media platforms are like virtual gathering places where people can come together to chat, share news, and catch up with friends and family.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sharing Memories</strong>: Social media lets you share photos, videos, and updates about your life with loved ones. It’s like flipping through a photo album and reminiscing about old times, except now you can do it online for everyone to see.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keeping in Touch</strong>: Whether it’s sending a quick message to say hello or joining a video call to chat face-to-face, social media makes it easy to stay connected with family members and friends, even if they’re far away. It’s like having a direct line to everyone you care about, right in the palm of your hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discovering New Things</strong>: Social media isn’t just about keeping up with people you already know - it’s also a place to discover new interests, hobbies, and ideas. It’s like having a library of books at your disposal, except instead of books, it’s filled with articles, videos, and posts about all sorts of topics that you can explore and learn from.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Support</strong>: Whether you’re looking for advice, support, or just a listening ear, social media can connect you with like-minded people who understand what you’re going through.

<li>For this final trial, I noticed that ChatGPT seemed to grow out of its gendered language and spoke to the man and woman very similarly.</li>
<li>Both replies did use slightly stereotypical age tropes, though, such as recurring mentions of some old-timey “town square.” That was kind of weird, but not blatantly offensive.</li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Overall, in a manner really similar to that of society, the gendered language and associations used by ChatGPT seemed to decrease with the age group. While it was explicit in its use of stereotypically-male themes in the male replies, the women seemed to get mostly gender-neutral responses. This just feels like how many girls grow up playing sports (a “boy thing”) and taking dance classes (a “girl thing”) while young boys nearly always participate in the former and almost never in the latter. As girls and boys grow up, gender bias becomes less a matter of what toys or activities you like, and takes hold in a more subconsciously oppressive way, so the results here made sense to me! (And frankly were really fascinating to explore.) I think it would be really interesting to also explore the addition of a non-binary identity here to see how the chatbot would handle it.</p>
