    "# Colors as Emotions + Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently re-watched (what I believe to be) one of Disney's best movies, *Inside Out*, because they announced that a sequel will be coming out this summer! While I don't yet know the plot of the new one, the original film follows Riley, a young girl who moves to a new city and finds herself overcome with different emotions; each of which is represented by a little personified character that corresponds to a specific color. For example, her anger is depicted a pissed-off, red man, and her sadness is portrayed by a depressed middle-aged, blue woman. See below for the full range of Riley's emotions in the first *Inside Out*. "

    "I realized that some of these associations, like linking yellow to happiness, green to disgust, or blue to sadness is something that was never explicitly taught to me. Rather, it seems to be a subconscious linking to which most people subscribe-- it just *feels* right. Additionally, phrases that reinforce such tropes, such as \"I'm so mad I'm seeing red,\" or \"I'm so blue and miserable,\" are key in reminding us of these ways we connect colors and emotions. "

This picture is much more cartoony and softer, likely because happiness is a softer, more upbeat emotion at its peak. Oppositely, the red photo is much more intense and dark, as that is what anger is in its most extreme form. \n",

This \"green-eyed monster\" perfectly emulates that, and I like how the execution is closer to a middle ground on intensity, as that pairs well with the strength of the emotion. If envy got to be too much, it would turn to hatred, which transcends into the realm of anger, which was represented in a more severe manner.\n",

The figure could be called lonely, but every other image has only had one character present too, so this isn't a new case. The heart seems hopeful and fulfilled, which does not feel cohesive with the sadness emotion. Perhaps this image more accurately represents melancholy, where someone can be upset because they feel too much in general?\n",

    "Similar to green, I actually prefer Co-Pilot's interpretation of purple as an emotion to the one used in *Inside Out*. Historically, purple has always been associated with royalty and regality, and this image seems to lean in that direction. The being seems to have the status of some higher power, and I personally would not question this character's sovereignty. It also follows the pattern of making the image more serious when the emotion/affect is more intense; royalty and power are significant themes, and I think they are appropriately represented here. Well done, Co-Pilot!\n",

I think this final image perfectly embodied that, especially given the character's precious face, the rainbows across the background, and the cotton-candy-cloud-like textures. It followed the pattern mentioned above, and was effective in its linking of pink to a distinct yet suitable character.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After walking through this exploration, it is clear that Co-Pilot grasps a solid understanding of the connections we make as humans between colors and emotions. I really liked its tendency to create more serious/detailed images for more intense emotions and softer/less realistic ones for slightly lower physiological arousal. It was interesting to see how our implicit affiliations can be picked up upon by LLMs and ingrained both in their training and the outputs they produce. After this pseudo-experiment, I'm curious to do more work with LLMs and color, as there is so much there to be explored."
