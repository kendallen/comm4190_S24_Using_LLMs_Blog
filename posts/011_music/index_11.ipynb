    "\n",
    "As soon as I heard about Suno, an AI platform that is able to generate songs, I knew I had to try it! I am a huge fan of music, from boybands, to rap, to musicals and more, I'm almost always listening to something in my headphones. For my first go-around with the technology-- given the limited number of credits I had with the free version-- I decided to use the \"Custom Mode\" (in which you can add lyrics, music style, and a title) to see how Suno interpreted pre-existing songs. To understand the full scope of its abilities, I tested on several genres and with artists I knew well to see how it matched their music generally. Here are my findings!"

    "### Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Billy Joel is one of my very favorite artists, so I wanted to kick off my experiment using one of his most iconic songs: \"Vienna.\" His music is more traditional in a way that I thought it would be slightly easier for Suno to replicate, especially because his style is older, his discography is massive, and his genre easily contained within the essential slow rock category. I fed Suno roughly half of the original song's lyrics (as it did have a word limit on the version I was using), and gave me the above tracks. The responses were really exciting, though certainly not perfect. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "- While the replicas did not follow the same beat/cadence of the original, I was really impressed by the fact that the technology was able to sing the lyrics in a way that kept them rhyming and in rhythm, even if it wasn't the same as the actual song.\n",
    "- The voice used genuinely has a robotic quality in a way I can't quite describe. While it sang in tune and even had somewhat complex harmonies, it felt soulless/flat, kind of like how singer's sound when they overuse auto-tune. \n",
    "- The style wasn't fully replicated, but honestly still adhered to the broader category of classic rock-- just not Billy Joel's version. The voices sound much younger than him, so the quality and tone is just really different.\n",
    "- I was really interested to see that the platform created cover art! I won't get into that in this post, though, as I plan to do a follow-up that explores the artwork Suno creates to match the songs. "

    "### Observations: \n",
    "\n",
    "One Direction is the only music group that I like as much as Billy Joel, and their British-boyband style is much more standardized and niche than the entire genre that is rock, so I thought they would be a good option to test next. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wow. These singers sound SO much more similar to 1D than the previous did to Billy Joel. Though the voices didn't sound precisely the same as the original song, they reminded me a lot of other songs by the band (\"One Thing\" and \"Up All Night\" specifically came to mind), so I'm assuming that One Direction's discography makes up a lot of the training data for boyband content on Suno.\n",
    "- Both songs do a really good job with incorporating the background vocals, denoted by the parentheses. They adhered exactly to the lyrics I inputted, which was really impressive.\n",
    "- Beyond following the lyrics exactly, these songs actually extended their length by repeating sections of the lyrics to reach the ~2-minute mark, though I didn't prompt Suno to do so. I thought this was very clever and a creative liberty that was useful without going against instructions.\n",
    "- These replicas actually did miss some of the rhyme schemes (eg: \"Would he say he's in L-O-V-E is meant to rhyme with \"Well if it was me\" and it did not in either case) but I still think they were really solid pieces. "

    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- So these are definitely the replicas that I like the least. I think because Kanye produces just unique music, this just fell flat. \n",
    "- The singers are now multiple genders! Really cool that Suno used a woman for the singing and a guy for the rap in the first version. Unfortunately, the guy sounds insanely white-- whereas Kanye is a black guy-- and the AI voice has very little cool factor like most rappers-- even with white guys, think of Eminem.\n",
    "- These songs also were extended via repeating lyrics which was nice! It would also be really cool to see it generate appropriate lyrics at the end on its own. I will play around with that in the future!\n",
    "- The rap section in V1 just sounds very stereotypical, both in voice and background. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I am SO glad I got to play around with Suno in this test. I was truly impressed with its complex understanding of music, even if the voices felt basic/dull or the rhyming was off at times, and enjoyed that it always offered two versions in its response to any prompt. I don't think we need to be worried about AI taking over the music industry just yet, but if Suno is any indication, AI is going to catch up pretty quickly. These songs might not be fully fleshed-out, but I would definitely consider adding them to a playlist or two."
