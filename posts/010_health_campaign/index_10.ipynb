    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, we learned from Dr. Andy Tan and his team about the role of AI in public health communications both as a tool for effective messaging and the spread of misinformation. We were tasked with building and evaluating a health campaign targeting a certain behavior with AI. Emmy and I partnered together to combat drunk driving, as the states we hail from (South Carolina and Missouri respectively) fall in the Top 10 for the highest annual number of drunk-driving incidents. To more comprehensively approach this, we created two campaigns, each tackling the issue from a different lens, being social and individual framing of the behavior.  Below is our process of going about this project!  "

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our process of creating and evaluating an anti-drunk-driving campaign completely through LLMs and AI-Generated images! Our goal is to raise awareness and promote responsible behavior behind the wheel by addressing both personal and social responsibility. We believe that every individual has a duty to themselves and others to avoid driving under the influence. Our two campaigns emphasize the consequences of drunk driving, for both the individual and for society as a whole. Through attention-grabbing slogans, powerful scripts, and compelling visual elements, we aim to encourage drivers to make the right choice and drive sober. Join us in spreading the message that responsible driving saves lives!"

    "#### Response:\n",
    "**Campaign Title: \"Don't Let Your Buzz Kill More Than the Party\"**\n",
    "**Campaign Message**: This campaign aims to highlight the potential consequences of drunk\n",
    "driving in an impactful way. By emphasizing the idea that a buzz from alcohol should not lead to\n",
    "the death of innocent lives, the campaign encourages individuals to take responsibility for their\n",
    "actions and make smart choices behind the wheel.\n",
    "**Slogan**: \"Be the Sober Hero of the Road!\"\n",
    "**Visual Elements**:\n",
    "1. **Poster/Infographic**: The central image features a split-screen view. On one side, there's a\n",
    "vibrant party scene with people laughing, dancing, and enjoying themselves. On the other side,\n",
    "there's a devastating car crash scene with emergency vehicles and injured individuals. The\n",
    "tagline \"Don't Let Your Buzz Kill More Than the Party\" is prominently displayed above the\n",
    "images, emphasizing the contrast between the two scenarios.\n",
    "2. **Social Media Graphics**: Create a series of shareable graphics featuring captions related to\n",
    "the campaign theme. For example:\n",
    "- Image of a smashed cocktail glass next to a wrecked car with the caption: \"A little too much\n",
    "buzz can turn into a buzzkill. Don't let it happen behind the wheel.\"\n",
    "- Illustration of a superhero cape with car keys attached, accompanied by the text: \"Be a hero.\n",
    "Save lives. Drive sober.\"\n",
    "3. **Video PSA**: Produce a short animated or live-action video PSA that tells the story of a\n",
    "person who decides to drive after drinking at a party. As they drive, the scene transitions to\n",
    "show the potential consequences of their actions, including a car crash and the aftermath. The\n",
    "video ends with a powerful message urging viewers to make the responsible choice and not let\n",
    "their buzz kill more than the party.\n",
    "4. **Interactive Website**: Develop an interactive website where visitors can explore different\n",
    "scenarios related to drunk driving and see the possible outcomes of their choices. Include\n",
    "quizzes, testimonials from survivors of drunk driving accidents, and resources for finding\n",
    "alternative transportation options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Campaign Strategy**:\n",
    "1. **Target Audience**: The campaign targets young adults aged 18-35 who are more likely to\n",
    "engage in social activities involving alcohol consumption. Additionally, it aims to reach out to\n",
    "their friends and family members who may influence their decision-making.\n",
    "2. **Distribution Channels**: Utilize a combination of social media platforms, outdoor advertising\n",
    "(e.g., billboards, bus shelters), and partnerships with local bars and restaurants to disseminate\n",
    "the campaign message. Collaborate with influencers and community leaders to amplify reach\n",
    "and engagement.\n",
    "3. **Engagement Tactics**: Encourage audience engagement through interactive elements such\n",
    "as quizzes, polls, and user-generated content contests. Encourage users to share their own\n",
    "stories or pledges to drive sober using campaign hashtags.\n",
    "4. **Partnerships and Collaborations**: Partner with local law enforcement agencies, healthcare\n",
    "providers, and nonprofit organizations focused on road safety to leverage their expertise and\n",
    "resources. Organize community events, workshops, and educational sessions to raise\n",
    "awareness about the dangers of drunk driving and promote safe alternatives.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation and Monitoring**: Track key metrics such as website traffic, social media\n",
    "engagement, and changes in attitudes and behaviors related to drunk driving. Conduct surveys\n",
    "and focus groups to gather feedback from the target audience and identify areas for\n",
    "improvement. Adjust the campaign strategy as needed based on performance data and\n",
    "audience insights.\n",
    "By implementing these strategies and leveraging the power of social proof, the \"Don't Let Your\n",
    "Buzz Kill More Than the Party\" campaign aims to make a lasting impact on reducing drunk\n",
    "driving accidents and saving lives."

    "health marketing campaign against drunk driving. We hail from two states in the top ten ranking\n",
    "for worst drunk driving tendencies– South Carolina and Missouri at #8 and #9 respectively– so\n",
    "this theme is particularly salient to us, especially given our age. When considering what would\n",
    "be most effective for this hypothetical campaign, we chose social and individual framing\n",
    "because of the somewhat socially normalized nature of the behavior and the psychology of\n",
    "individual selfishness.\n",
    "Our exploration of the capabilities of ChatGPT and Microsoft Co-Pilot in this project\n",
    "yielded results we could not have begun to anticipate, and we were truly impressed by the\n",
    "creativity, comprehensive attention to detail, and adaptability demonstrated by these LLMs. To\n",
    "conclude, we want to share some final observations and opinions.\n",
    "As for the benefits of using AI in our campaign creation, we were shocked by the\n",
    "originality of the ideas ChatGPT offered for both the individual and social lenses. Without\n",
    "sacrificing creativity, the platform generated multiple proposals in mere seconds rather than the\n",
    "hours or days it might’ve taken a person to do so. Additionally, the ideas were well-fleshed out\n",
    "and offered different channels of distribution, types of graphics, website possibilities, and more.\n",
    "This is all to say that in terms of brainstorming, AI can be an incredible tool to both offer lots of\n",
    "ideas and hone in on certain concepts. Still, it is important to note that we did run into some\n",
    "trouble when we tried to have Co-Pilot evaluate both proposals as well as engage effectively\n",
    "with our feedback within its Dalle-3 integration.\n",
    "Our main issue with AI’s assistance in our campaign was how Co-Pilot seemed unable\n",
    "to take our critiques to tweak the images it produced. If we asked for it to add color, it might\n",
    "change the entire genre of the drawing, or if we wanted it to feature a specific element, it might\n",
    "ignore that request entirely. We discussed with Professor O’Donnell how Dalle-3 takes your\n",

    "investigating the way that it does this more in detail. Still, it proved frustrating, and given the\n",
    "other challenges of inaccurate text, miscellaneous additions, and varying stylistic choices, we\n",
    "think that human artists still come out on top (or at least they do for now!). Lastly, we were really\n",
    "surprised when Co-Pilot preferred our social framing proposal, as we anticipated that human\n",
    "respondents would be more moved by the individual framing given psycho-social drives being\n",
    "more independent, especially for young Americans. We did not know if Co-Pilot was unaware of\n",
    "this norm, though, because it seemed to evaluate the campaigns on how emotionally stirring\n",
