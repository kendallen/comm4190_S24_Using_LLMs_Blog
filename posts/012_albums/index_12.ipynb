    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After I played around with Suno AI in my last notebook, I knew that my initial exploration wasn't even a scratch on the surface of all that the platform offered. Beyond its generation of music, lyrics, and harmonies, it also offers the user an AI-generated album cover for their new song. Throughout this blog, I've been the most fascinated by the generative art capabilities held by platforms like Microsoft Co-Pilot, so I wanted to dive more deeply into the covers Suno created while comparing them to both the real album cover and one generated by Co-Pilot using its Dalle-3 integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "My process was to choose three songs from different genres that all had album covers that were not person-focused or too realistic. I prompted Co-Pilot with the same information I gave Suno, which was the first 1/3 or so of the given song's lyrics, the song's style-- as I determined at my own discretion using both internet evaluations and my own opinions--, and the title of the song.

    "\n",
    "I'm immediately laughing at the sheer difference between Suno and Co-Pilot's interpretation of the prompt!\n",
    "\n",
    "- It seems like Suno is going to generally provide more basic covers, especially given that its focus is on the music it produces rather than the accompanying art.\n",
    "- It's funny that Suno was more accurate to the original art given its more basic, graphic style, but I think this is really just a result of the disjunction between the original song and the cover in terms of genre and lyrics.\n",
    "- Co-Pilot seems to have run with many stereotypes of rap, being money, death, and alcohol (?), but I am curious as to why it would engage an art style so unlike most rap covers these days. Nothing is really ever this high-tech feeling, so this feels a bit off from the prompt.\n",
    "- Good job to Co-Pilot for adding the Explicit/Parental Advisory warning on the cover! This is really true to form and I was impressed it replicated it so well.\n",

    "- Co-Pilot really leaned into the stereotypes of the genre, but I didn't mind it! The colors and energy at right, and I liked its attempt to incorporate the \"kids\" in from the song. \n",

    "- Co-Pilot killed it! Very colorful and in a graphic style. I could see this one actually being used by some indie group, and the \"cold man\" sitting atop the mountain was an interesting manifestation of the prompt. I was very excited about this one.  \n",

    "As expected, Suno is not yet as advanced in its art generation as Co-Pilot or human-creation. While this was a fun exercise, there wasn't a ton of art produced that closely mimicked the original, though I really enjoyed seeing how LLMs responded to my prompting with their own creations. :)"
