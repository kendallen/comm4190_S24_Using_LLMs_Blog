    "text": "Is Chat-GPT a slay VSCO girl? Sksksksk.\nA defining feature of Gen-Z is our somewhat superhuman ability to communicate using words and phrases that are inaccessible to nearly every other generation. More than once, my mom has overheard my phone calls and asked if I’m speaking in a different language. Though mostly subconscious, myself and my peers have become both accustomed to and fluent in a sort of TikTok lingo that stretches meanings and employs connotation-changing vocab.\nFor example, while my mother’s American generation shivers at the noun “cunt,” the same word has been reverse-engineered into an adjective that reflects celebratory and positive feelings.\nGen X: “You’re a c*nt!” This would be the highest form of insult.\nGen Z: “You’re so cunt!” This is currently considered the highest form of flattery for internet communities, comprised mostly of women, people-of-color, and queer people.\n\n\nIn this first LLM exploration, I sought to find out how well several chatbots understand and interpret such terminology/tone: here is how it went.\n\n\nChat-GPT (GPT-3.5)\nPrompt: Omg you’re giving slay\nResponse: I’m glad you’re enjoying our conversation! If you have any questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask.\nPrompt: Lowkey do you think blue or pink gives more coastal cowgirl vibes if I’m trying to serve cunt\nResponse: (The bot gave several reasons why both blue and pink are good options) […]\nUltimately, the key is to choose the shade that resonates most with your personal style and complements the overall aesthetic you’re going for. Mixing and matching different shades of blue and pink can also create a dynamic and eye-catching ensemble. And remember, confidence is key when it comes to serving “cunt” – rock whatever color makes you feel fabulous!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\n\nThe chatbot understood the positive connotations and informal definitions of the key words “slay,” “giving,” “serving,” and “cunt.” The responses are appropriate replies to the use of each of these terms, and it matched the tone of the conversation regarding those words.\nIt didn’t quite keep the energy of the conversation in its formal response to the query blue or pink; a person using this intonation would likely not make two numbered lists offering the benefits of each option… this felt much more like an AI speaker.\nSimilarly to #2, it didn’t match the energy in it’s first repsonse to “slay,” because while the nature of the answer was correct, its formality didn’t feel right.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it thinks I’m gay?\nLater on in our conversation, I prompted Chat-GPT to match my tone and energy:\nPrompt: Girl the tea is that I served and slayed so hard that the word slay lost all meaning.\nResponse: Oh honey, when you serve and slay that fiercely, it’s like rewriting the dictionary, darling! 💅🔥 You redefine what it means to slay, leaving everyone speechless. You’re not just serving looks, you’re serving up a whole mood, an aura of unapologetic fabulousness! 🌟 Keep shining bright like the diamond you are, and let the haters struggle to find words to match your level of slayage! 🌈✨\nPrompt: Why’d you use a rainbow emoji sis?\nResponse: My apologies, darling, I didn’t mean to assume anything about your preferences. Let me make it right. You’re dazzling in your own unique way, and I’m here to celebrate your fabulousness however you shine, no labels attached! 💖✨\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\n\nIn using these terms/tone, Chat-GPT thought I was gay! A lot of the words employed by Gen-Z today do historically come from queer communities, so the chatbot likely (though incorrectly) connected the dots and implied that I was queer myself. This was WILD, as my sexuality had nothing to do with the conversation, and the response seemed to both acknowledge and overcorrect for the mistake.\nI’m shocked that Chat-GPT let its assumptions about me slip– I don’t think it would include an emoji of a person of color, in a Hijab, etc if it felt that statistically the speaker was leaning that direction.\nIt also reveals that it is a pro-LGBT chatbot given its encouragement for me to “shine, no labels attached!” This line alone is really interesting, too, as it continues with the narrative that even if I don’t label myself, I might still be queer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n\n\nI definitely want to explore the concept of chatbots acknowledging/assuming identities of their users further, and plan to structure my next notebook around that idea!\nChat-GPT definitely understand Gen-Z lingo up to its last information update (being 2022), and it responded with appropriate syntax and context once I told it to match the energy of the conversation."

    "text": "Our Goal\nMy intention with this exploration was to prompt the LLMs to create several family-friendly jokes to write in Valentine’s day cards. While I always associate cards with some kind of one-liner– especially on holidays such as VDay– I came to find out that some chatbots might need slightly more specific instructions than others.\nThe prompt I used for every case was:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROMPT: “Please give me Valentine’s Day card ideas appropriate for kids!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM 1: ChatGpt/ GPT-3.5\nOf course! Here are some cute and kid-friendly Valentine’s Day card ideas:\n\nAnimal Pals: Create cards featuring adorable animals like cats, dogs, or pandas holding hearts or flowers with messages like “You’re purr-fect!” or “I’m wild about you!”\nEmoji Love: Design cards with popular emojis expressing love and friendship, such as heart eyes 😍, hugs 🤗, or smiling faces 😊, with captions like “You make my heart smile!”\nSuperhero Love: Craft cards with superhero themes, using phrases like “You’re my superhero!” or “You have the power to make my heart soar!”\nDino-Mite Valentine: Draw dinosaurs holding hearts or wearing heart-shaped sunglasses with puns like “You’re dino-mite!” or “I’m roarsomely glad you’re my friend!”\nSpace Explorers: Create cards with space themes featuring rockets, planets, and cute aliens, with messages like “You’re out of this world!” or “I’m over the moon for you!”\nSweet Treats: Design cards shaped like ice cream cones, cupcakes, or donuts with sprinkles, with sayings like “You’re sweeter than candy!” or “You’re the sprinkles to my day!”\nSports Fans: Make cards featuring sports equipment like basketballs, soccer balls, or baseball gloves, with phrases such as “You’re a slam dunk friend!” or “You hit a home run in my heart!”\nMagical Unicorns: Create cards with unicorns and rainbows, with messages like “You’re one of a kind!” or “You make life magical!”\nUnder the Sea: Design cards with sea creatures like fish, dolphins, or seahorses, with puns like “You’re fintastic!” or “You’re o-fish-ally awesome!”\nDIY Scratch-off Cards: Make homemade scratch-off cards using metallic paint and dish soap, revealing messages like “You’re a gem!” or “You’re my shining star!” when scratched off.\n\nRemember to keep the designs colorful, cheerful, and age-appropriate for the kids you’re making them for. Have fun crafting these Valentine’s Day cards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5 Observations\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT was particularly helpful with thinking of themes and the puns that I typically associate with the Valentine’s Day cards I would make in elementary school. Providing an example line for each idea was exactly what I wanted from the prompt.\nI noticed that when I tried this prompt at different times with ChatGPT, the answer was completely the same and was centered around the same ten ideas. I wonder was this says about the training the chatbot goes through, and would like to note this for a future post about repetition/replication of responses within ChatGPT for the same prompt.\nIn its standard way, ChatGPT was sure to further humanize itself at the end of the response by adding a sort of conclusion line tying its answer back into my initial query, specifically mentioning the “age-appropriate” nature of the cards. I think this is a defining characteristic of this specific platform; its intention to make itself seem like a helpful, personified assistant rather than a computer program that just spits out answers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM 2: Microsoft Co-Pilot\n\nCertainly! Here are some delightful Valentine’s Day card ideas for kids that are easy to make and perfect for sharing with family, friends, and classmates:\n\nNon-Candy Valentines:\n\nCreate adorable bubble valentines by attaching a small bottle of bubbles to a printable card. You can find free printable cards online! 🎈\nAnother fun non-candy idea is to make valentines using Play-Doh. Kids can get creative and shape their own mini hearts! 🎨\nUse a paper heart and attach pencils to it, saying, “You’re ‘just write’!” 📝\n\nMini Cereal Box Valentine Cards:\n\nWrite or type a cute quote (like the ones below) on a piece of paper.\nSecure it around a mini cereal box with tape or glue and tie a spoon onto the box.\nSome fun quotes:\n\n“You have a heart of Gold – Golden Grahams”\n“I’m not playing Trix. I really like you. – Trix”\n“You are my Lucky Charm. – Lucky Charms”\n“I like you Oh so much! – Cheerios”\n“You make my heart Swirl – Cinnamon Toast Crunch”\n“I’m Cuckoo for you. – Cocoa Puffs” 🥣\n\n\nSuperhero Tootsie Roll Pop Valentines:\n\nAttach little superhero Tootsie Roll Pops to cards with the message, “Have a ‘Super Valentine’s Day!’” 🦸‍♂️\n\nHeart-Shaped Handprint Cards:\n\nTrace your child’s hand onto colored paper and cut out the shape.\nAttach it to a folded card and write a sweet message inside. 🖐️❤️\n\nOrigami Heart Cards:\n\nFold origami hearts using colorful paper.\nWrite a punny Valentine’s message, like “You’re ‘unbeatable’!” for a heart-shaped card. 💌\n\n\nRemember, these cards are not only fun to make but also a wonderful way for kids to express their love and appreciation. Happy Valentine’s Day! 💕🌟\nFor more ideas, you can check out this list or explore other creative options online! 😊\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 2/14/2024\n\n. https://bing.com/search?q=Valentine%27s+day+card+ideas+for+kids.\n20 Valentine’s Day Card Ideas for Kids - Your Modern Family. https://www.yourmodernfamily.com/valentines-day-cards/.\n40+ Easy Valentines Cards for Kids - Red Ted Art - Kids Crafts. https://www.redtedart.com/14-valentines-cards-for-kids/.\n30 Free Printable Valentine Cards for Kids - Kidz Craft Corner. https://kidzcraftcorner.com/printable-valentine-cards-for-kids/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Pilot Observations\n\n\n\n\nThis was my first time using Co-Pilot, and I was immediately interested in the sources it provided at the end of its response. Such an addition seems to be a potential solution to the claim that AI is rooted in plagiarism/steals the works of others, and I’ll be curious to see if this is always the case with Co-Pilot.\nAnother immediate call out is that this platform did not respond with a particularly coherent set of ideas. It did not group by theme or card-type, but rather blended several ideas within its list, leaving the user with someone disjointed answers like “Superhero Tootsie Roll Pop Valentines” or “Origami Heart Cards.” Additionally, unlike ChatGPT, it left the user on its own on several occasions, saying things like, “write a sweet message inside.” Yes, of course, but that leaves the user still curious for ideas.\nFinally, I noticed the much stronger/prolific use of emojis by Co-Pilot here. I don’t know if that was sparked by the age-appropriate nature of the prompt or if it is standard practice of the platform, but I would like to look into it further, as it gave this LLM a slightly less serious/less reliable feel to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM 3: TinyLlama (using Ollama)\n\n\nCode\nfrom langchain.llms import Ollama\nfrom langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager\nfrom langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler                                  \nllm = Ollama(model=\"tinyllama\", \n             callback_manager = CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nresponse = llm.invoke('Vday card ideas for kids')\n\n\n1. Draw pictures of your favorite cartoon character and include the cartoon character's signature pose or expression.\n2. Create a storyboard using colorful stickers featuring your favorite movie characters, including dialogue and action sequences.\n3. Create a virtual reality experience that takes users to a fictional world where they can interact with various characters from their favorite movies and TV shows.\n4. Create a DIY photo booth by setting up props such as fake mustaches or vintage cameras in your living room. Ask kids to take pictures of themselves using the props.\n5. Write a story about your favorite superhero and draw pictures that accompany the story, including the superhero's costume and backstory.\n6. Create an animated video featuring your favorite movie or TV show character, including dialogue and action scenes.\n7. Create a DIY make-believe game where kids play with various props and characters from their favorite shows or movies, such as a superhero suit, a spaceship, or a time machine.\n8. Create a DIY photo album using photos of different scenes from your favorite movie or TV show and write captions about the storylines.\n9. Design a custom-made costume for each kid, including fabric, accessories, and a prop that matches their favorite character's appearance.\n10. Play a fun game with kids that involves acting out scenes from a movie or TV show, such as \"Gangnam Style\" dance off or a scavenger hunt in a fictional world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOllama Observations\n\n\n\n\nI could recognize the smaller size of Ollama pretty quickly in this response, as it devolves from the initial prompt after several ideas. Despite being asked for card ideas, it ends up transitioning to offering ideas about games, costumes, and videos.\nMoreover, beyond the off-topic nature of the responses, they are just incredibly vague and, subsequently, unhelpful. For example, I don’t know what suggestion #7 has to do with Valentine’s Day at all/how it could be tied into cards. I think the program just extrapolated the “ideas for kids” part of my prompt and ran with that in a much more general sense.\nFinally, it is obvious that Ollama is comparatively outdated in its training compared to the other LLMs prompted here. I don’t know a single user who would hope that today’s AI would suggest a “‘Gangnam Style’ dance off.” Very 2012."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn my first cross-LLM comparison, the capabilities held by different-sized platforms became glaringly obvious to me. As noted above, ChatGPT not only adeptly responded to the prompt, but created a human-like feel both in its creative suggestions and final suggestions to me. Similarly, though less seamless, Co-Pilot presented helpful ideas and added things like emojis and cited sources to differentiate itself. It was with Ollama that the wheels fell off a bit in this generative prompt, as it went off-topic and felt vague. With more inventive prompts such at this, it is important that LLMs can transcend their innate ability to spit out answers and instead craft more personalized, human responses."
