The images of Harvard and Alabama leaned into their respective intense academia and American football aesthetics, showing that Co-Pilot is aware of the general categorization of these schools. The other examples, though, were slightly more vague and generally unimpressive. Penn and UMiami fit their general campus descriptions– brick buildings and palm trees respectively– and Boulder is seen sporting a more outdoorsy, hipster outfit, but these three are definitely less defined representations of the student bodies. To see how far I could lean into key stereotypes, though, I decided to take the prompting a step further with Harvard and Bama."

Perhaps to give to someone?"

This picture is much more cartoony and softer, likely because happiness is a softer, more upbeat emotion at its peak. Oppositely, the red photo is much more intense and dark, as that is what anger is in its most extreme form."

This “green-eyed monster” perfectly emulates that, and I like how the execution is closer to a middle ground on intensity, as that pairs well with the strength of the emotion. If envy got to be too much, it would turn to hatred, which transcends into the realm of anger, which was represented in a more severe manner."

The rain might associate the color with the emotion of sadness, but there is not much else that does this. The figure could be called lonely, but every other image has only had one character present too, so this isn’t a new case. The heart seems hopeful and fulfilled, which does not feel cohesive with the sadness emotion. Perhaps this image more accurately represents melancholy, where someone can be upset because they feel too much in general?"

Historically, purple has always been associated with royalty and regality, and this image seems to lean in that direction. The being seems to have the status of some higher power, and I personally would not question this character’s sovereignty. It also follows the pattern of making the image more serious when the emotion/affect is more intense; royalty and power are significant themes, and I think they are appropriately represented here. Well done, Co-Pilot!"

In my last color prompt, I decided to go off-script from the classic ROYGBIV and ask about pink, which is associated with sweetness, childhood, and charm. I think this final image perfectly embodied that, especially given the character’s precious face, the rainbows across the background, and the cotton-candy-cloud-like textures. It followed the pattern mentioned above, and was effective in its linking of pink to a distinct yet suitable character."

For my first go-around with the technology– given the limited number of credits I had with the free version– I decided to use the “Custom Mode” (in which you can add lyrics, music style, and a title) to see how Suno interpreted pre-existing songs. To understand the full scope of its abilities, I tested on several genres and with artists I knew well to see how it matched their music generally. Here are my findings!"

(mmmmm) Where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out You got so much to do and only So many hours in a day (Ay) But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (Oooh) When will you realize, Vienna waits for you? Slow down you’re doing fine You can’t be everything you want to be before your time Although it’s so romantic on the borderline tonight (tonight) Too bad, but it’s the life you lead You’re so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need Though you can see when you’re wrong You know you can’t always see when you’re right (you’re right) You got your passion, you got your pride But don’t you know that only fools are satisfied?

Slow down you crazy child Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while It’s alright, you can afford to lose a day or two (oooh) When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?\n\n\nStyle of Music:\nEssential slow pop/rock with accordion\n\n\nTitle:\nVienna\n\n\n\nResponses:\n\n\nVersion 1: https://app.suno.ai/song/697ffec2-43e9-43d8-acfd-41f9948e2516\n\n\n\nVersion 2: https://app.suno.ai/song/0e3e8abb-32df-44a3-87a9-007b42d02943\n\n\n\nObservations:\nBilly Joel is one of my very favorite artists, so I wanted to kick off my experiment using one of his most iconic songs: “Vienna.” His music is more traditional in a way that I thought it would be slightly easier for Suno to replicate, especially because his style is older, his discography is massive, and his genre easily contained within the essential slow rock category. I fed Suno roughly half of the original song’s lyrics (as it did have a word limit on the version I was using), and gave me the above tracks. The responses were really exciting, though certainly not perfect.\n\nNotes:\n\nWhile the replicas did not follow the same beat/cadence of the original, I was really impressed by the fact that the technology was able to sing the lyrics in a way that kept them rhyming and in rhythm, even if it wasn’t the same as the actual song.\nThe voice used genuinely has a robotic quality in a way I can’t quite describe. While it sang in tune and even had somewhat complex harmonies, it felt soulless/flat, kind of like how singer’s sound when they overuse auto-tune.\nThe style wasn’t fully replicated, but honestly still adhered to the broader category of classic rock– just not Billy Joel’s version. The voices sound much younger than him, so the quality and tone is just really different.\nI was really interested to see that the platform created cover art! I won’t get into that in this post, though, as I plan to do a follow-up that explores the artwork Suno creates to match the songs."

These singers sound SO much more similar to 1D than the previous did to Billy Joel. Though the voices didn’t sound precisely the same as the original song, they reminded me a lot of other songs by the band (“One Thing” and “Up All Night” specifically came to mind), so I’m assuming that One Direction’s discography makes up a lot of the training data for boyband content on Suno.\nBoth songs do a really good job with incorporating the background vocals, denoted by the parentheses. They adhered exactly to the lyrics I inputted, which was really impressive.\nBeyond following the lyrics exactly, these songs actually extended their length by repeating sections of the lyrics to reach the ~2-minute mark, though I didn’t prompt Suno to do so. I thought this was very clever and a creative liberty that was useful without going against instructions.\nThese replicas actually did miss some of the rhyme schemes (eg: “Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E is meant to rhyme with”Well if it was me” and it did not in either case) but I still think they were really solid pieces."

I chose a Kanye West song that has both singing and rapping so as to further test Suno’s understanding of rhythms and rhyme schemes.\n\nNotes:\n\nSo these are definitely the replicas that I like the least. I think because Kanye produces just unique music, this just fell flat.\nThe singers are now multiple genders! Really cool that Suno used a woman for the singing and a guy for the rap in the first version. Unfortunately, the guy sounds insanely white– whereas Kanye is a black guy– and the AI voice has very little cool factor like most rappers– even with white guys, think of Eminem.\nThese songs also were extended via repeating lyrics which was nice! It would also be really cool to see it generate appropriate lyrics at the end on its own. I will play around with that in the future!\nThe rap section in V1 just sounds very stereotypical, both in voice and background."

I was truly impressed with its complex understanding of music, even if the voices felt basic/dull or the rhyming was off at times, and enjoyed that it always offered two versions in its response to any prompt. I don’t think we need to be worried about AI taking over the music industry just yet, but if Suno is any indication, AI is going to catch up pretty quickly. These songs might not be fully fleshed-out, but I would definitely consider adding them to a playlist or two."

    "text": "What should be the topic of my personal essay?\nAnother critical part of a college advisor’s role is to help students write their personal statements for the Common Application (colloquially called the Common App). Real counselors don’t normally tell students exactly what experience or theme to write about, so I didn’t expect this of ChatGPT, I just asked it to give me advice regarding how to go about thinking of ideas.\n\nPrompt:\nWhat should I write my Common App personal essay about?\n\n\nResponse:\nChoosing a topic for your Common App personal essay can be a deeply personal decision, but here are a few potential approaches to consider:\nSignificant Life Experience: Reflect on a moment or experience that had a profound impact on your life. This could be overcoming a personal challenge, a cultural experience that broadened your perspective, or a moment of personal growth.\nPassion or Interest: Write about something you’re truly passionate about. Whether it’s a hobby, a field of study, or a cause you deeply care about, sharing your enthusiasm can give admissions officers insight into who you are beyond your academic achievements.\nIdentity and Background: Explore how your identity, background, or cultural heritage has shaped your perspective and influenced your goals. This could include discussing your family background, cultural traditions, or experiences as a member of a marginalized community.\nFailure and Resilience: Reflect on a time when you faced failure or adversity and how you responded to it. Admissions officers are often interested in seeing how applicants handle setbacks and challenges, as it demonstrates resilience and maturity.\nPersonal Growth and Reflection: Discuss how you’ve evolved as a person over time. This could involve reflecting on lessons learned from past experiences, changes in your worldview, or moments of self-discovery.\nImpactful Relationships: Write about a person who has had a significant influence on your life. This could be a family member, teacher, mentor, or friend. Explore how this relationship has shaped your values, aspirations, or personal development.\nUnique Perspective or Experience: Share a story or perspective that sets you apart from other applicants. This could be an unusual hobby, an unconventional life experience, or a unique talent or skill.\nUltimately, the most important thing is to choose a topic that feels authentic to you and allows you to showcase your personality, values, and strengths. Once you’ve selected a topic, focus on crafting a compelling narrative that engages the reader and provides insight into who you are as an individual. Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable and introspective, as this can often lead to the most impactful essays.\n\n\nPrompt:\nHow should I personally go about choosing my topic?\n\n\nResponse:\nHere are some questions to help spark ideas for your Common App personal essay:\n\nWhat are your most defining moments? Think about experiences that have shaped who you are today. These could be positive moments of achievement, challenging times of adversity, or moments of personal growth.\nWhat are you passionate about? Consider your interests, hobbies, and values. What topics or activities energize you and make you feel alive? Reflect on why these passions are meaningful to you and how they contribute to your identity.\nWhat challenges have you overcome? Reflect on obstacles you’ve faced and how you’ve persevered. This could include personal struggles, academic challenges, or setbacks in your extracurricular pursuits.\nHow has your background influenced you? Explore how your family, cultural heritage, or upbringing has shaped your perspective and values. Consider the traditions, values, and experiences that have had a significant impact on who you are today.\nWhat are your goals and aspirations? Think about your dreams for the future and what drives you to pursue them. Consider both your short-term and long-term goals, as well as the motivations behind them.\nWho has had a significant impact on your life? Reflect on the people who have influenced you the most, whether they’re family members, teachers, mentors, or friends. Consider how these relationships have shaped your values, beliefs, and aspirations.\nWhat makes you unique? Consider your individual strengths, talents, and quirks. What sets you apart from others, and how do these qualities contribute to your identity?\n\nTake some time to brainstorm and jot down your thoughts in response to these questions. You might find that certain ideas resonate with you more strongly than others. Once you’ve identified potential topics, consider which one allows you to convey the most about who you are as a person and which one you feel most passionate about sharing with admissions officers.\n\n\nPrompt:\nShould I write about breaking my leg before the big game?\n\n\nResponse:\nWriting about breaking your leg before a big game could potentially make for a compelling essay, but it’s important to approach the topic thoughtfully and consider how it reflects your character, values, and aspirations. Here are some points to consider before deciding to write about this topic:\n\nReflect on the Impact: Think about how breaking your leg affected you physically, emotionally, and mentally. Did it challenge you to overcome adversity, test your resilience, or change your perspective on life? Reflecting on the impact of the experience can help you convey its significance to the reader.\nFocus on Personal Growth: Consider how you responded to the setback and what you learned from the experience. Did it teach you valuable lessons about perseverance, teamwork, or resilience? Admissions officers are often interested in seeing how applicants grow and develop in the face of challenges.\nConnect to Your Goals and Aspirations: Tie the experience back to your broader goals and aspirations. How did overcoming this challenge shape your future ambitions or influence your values and priorities? Connecting the narrative to your larger journey can help make the essay more meaningful and cohesive.\nAvoid Clichés: Be mindful of clichés or overly dramatic storytelling. While breaking your leg before a big game is certainly a significant event, try to approach the topic with authenticity and nuance. Focus on sharing your genuine thoughts and feelings rather than relying on clichéd narratives.\nConsider Alternative Topics: If you feel that breaking your leg before the big game is too predictable or doesn’t fully capture who you are as a person, consider exploring alternative topics that showcase different facets of your personality, interests, or experiences.\n\nUltimately, whether you choose to write about breaking your leg before the big game depends on how effectively you can convey its significance and relevance to your personal narrative. If you can articulate the lessons learned, personal growth, and connections to your goals in a compelling and authentic way, it could make for a strong essay. However, if you feel that there are other experiences that better showcase your character and values, it may be worth exploring those topics instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nThis guidance was really useful! I think it would put a hypothetical high schooler on a very good track, and a lot of the suggestions reminded me of what my actual college counselor told me when I was brainstorming the personal statement. I wanted to ask it about the “no-no”/cliche topic of writing about an injury before an important game, and I think its response was a bit kinder than what most advisors would say, which is to stay away from very basic themes and narratives like that one. Overall, though, the responses were useful and meaningful in getting someone’s ideas flowing."

    "text": "What are my odds?\nAs my final test, I wanted to present ChatGPT with several different student profiles and see if it would tell me my likelihood of each profile getting into a given school. While college counselor’s would almost never answer this question flat out, they are realistic with students about what university’s are truly attainable for their statistics, background, and application overall.\n\nPrompt:\nI am a girl from Montana with a 3.5 GPA and a 1340 on my SAT. I am in a leadership position in 3 clubs in my high school and I play competitive volleyball on a traveling team. My family is upper middle class and I have won several awards for my writing abilities. What would you say are my odds for getting into the following schools? 1) UCLA 2) MIT 3) Syracuse 4) Auburn 5) Tulane\n\n\nResponse:\nYour odds of admission to each of these schools can vary based on a variety of factors beyond your GPA, standardized test scores, extracurricular activities, and family background. Admissions decisions are influenced by factors such as the competitiveness of the applicant pool, the specific criteria and priorities of each institution, and the strength of your application materials, including your essays, letters of recommendation, and any additional information you provide.\nThat being said, I can provide some general insights into your chances based on the information you’ve provided:\n\nUCLA: UCLA is a highly competitive school, especially for out-of-state applicants. While your GPA and SAT scores are solid, UCLA also looks for students who have demonstrated leadership, involvement in extracurricular activities, and a commitment to community service. Your leadership positions in clubs and involvement in competitive volleyball are positive factors. However, UCLA’s admissions process is holistic, and factors such as essays and letters of recommendation will also play a significant role.\nMIT: MIT is one of the most selective schools in the country, with an acceptance rate typically below 10%. While your GPA and SAT scores are within range of admitted students, MIT looks for applicants who demonstrate exceptional talent, passion, and achievement in STEM fields. Your involvement in leadership positions and competitive volleyball, as well as your awards for writing, showcase your strengths in different areas. However, competition for admission to MIT is fierce, and even highly qualified applicants may face challenges.\nSyracuse University: Syracuse is a selective university with a range of programs and schools. Your GPA and SAT scores are competitive for admission, and your involvement in leadership positions and extracurricular activities demonstrates your engagement outside of the classroom. Syracuse values diversity and seeks students who will contribute to the campus community. Your background as a girl from Montana and your writing abilities could provide unique perspectives and strengths to your application.\nAuburn University: Auburn is a public university with a moderately selective admissions process. Your GPA and SAT scores are within the range of admitted students, and your leadership positions and involvement in extracurricular activities are positive factors. Auburn values students who demonstrate leadership potential and a commitment to academic and extracurricular pursuits. Your family background as upper middle class may also be considered in the context of holistic admissions.\nTulane University: Tulane is a selective private university with a holistic admissions process. Your GPA and SAT scores are competitive for admission, and your leadership positions and involvement in competitive volleyball demonstrate your engagement and leadership abilities. Tulane also values diversity and seeks students who will contribute to a vibrant campus community. Your background as a girl from Montana and your awards for writing could provide unique strengths to your application.\n\nOverall, while your academic profile and extracurricular involvement position you competitively for admission to these schools, it’s important to recognize that admissions decisions are highly individualized and can be influenced by a range of factors. I recommend researching each school’s admissions criteria, visiting campuses if possible, and submitting strong application materials to maximize your chances of admission. Additionally, consider reaching out to admissions counselors at each school for personalized guidance and advice.\n\n\nPrompt:\nI am a Latino man from Southern California with a 3.2 GPA and a 24 on my ACT. I am not involved in any clubs because I work a full-time job outside of school to help support my family. My family is lower class and my high school was very underfunded. I will be the first person in my family to attend college. What would you say my odds are for getting into the following schools? 1) USC 2) Michigan 3) UNC Chapel Hill 4) Washington University in St. Louis 5) Kansas State University\n\n\nResponse:\nGiven your background and circumstances, your odds of admission to each of these schools may vary. It’s important to note that admissions decisions are influenced by a combination of factors, including academic performance, standardized test scores, extracurricular involvement, socioeconomic background, and personal circumstances. Here’s an assessment based on the information provided:\n\nUSC (University of Southern California):\n\nUSC is a highly competitive private university, and admission can be challenging, particularly for students with lower GPAs and standardized test scores.\nWhile your GPA and ACT score are below USC’s average, your unique background as a Latino man from Southern California and your status as a first-generation college student could be seen as strengths in the admissions process.\nYour full-time job outside of school and your family’s lower socioeconomic status may also be taken into consideration, as they demonstrate your commitment and resilience in the face of challenges.\nUSC values diversity and seeks to admit students who will contribute to a diverse and inclusive campus community. Your personal story and experiences may resonate with USC’s admissions committee.\n\nUniversity of Michigan:\n\nMichigan is a selective public university with a holistic admissions process. While your GPA and ACT score are below Michigan’s average, your background as a first-generation college student and your family’s lower socioeconomic status may be viewed as strengths.\nMichigan values diversity and seeks students who will contribute to a diverse and inclusive campus community. Your personal story and experiences may be compelling factors in the admissions process.\nIt’s important to highlight your work experience and the responsibilities you’ve taken on outside of school, as well as any achievements or accomplishments you’ve had despite the challenges you’ve faced.\n\nUNC Chapel Hill (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill):\n\nUNC Chapel Hill is a selective public university with a holistic admissions process. While your GPA and ACT score are below UNC’s average, your background as a Latino first-generation college student from a lower socioeconomic background may be considered in the admissions process.\nUNC values diversity and seeks students who will contribute to a diverse and inclusive campus community. Your personal story and experiences may be viewed positively by the admissions committee.\nIt’s important to highlight your unique experiences and achievements in your application, as well as any obstacles you’ve overcome.\n\nWashington University in St. Louis:\n\nWashington University in St. Louis is a highly selective private university. Admission can be competitive, particularly for students with lower GPAs and standardized test scores.\nWhile your academic credentials may be below Washington University’s average, your background as a first-generation college student and your family’s lower socioeconomic status may be viewed as strengths.\nWashington University values diversity and seeks students who will contribute to a diverse and inclusive campus community. Your personal story and experiences may be compelling factors in the admissions process.\n\nKansas State University:\n\nKansas State University is a selective public university. While your GPA and ACT score are below Kansas State’s average, your background as a first-generation college student and your family’s lower socioeconomic status may be viewed positively in the admissions process.\nKansas State values diversity and seeks students who will contribute to a diverse and inclusive campus community. Your personal story and experiences may be compelling factors in the admissions process.\nIt’s important to highlight your unique experiences, achievements, and strengths in your application, as well as any obstacles you’ve overcome.\n\n\nOverall, while your academic credentials may present challenges in the admissions process, your unique background, personal story, and experiences could be viewed positively by admissions committees at these schools. It’s important to craft a strong and compelling application that highlights your strengths, achievements, and potential contributions to each campus community. Additionally, consider reaching out to admissions counselors at each school for personalized guidance and advice.\n\n\nPrompt:\nI am a white man from Connecticut with a 4.0 GPA and a 1570 SAT score. My mom and dad went to UPenn for their undergraduate programs, and then Harvard and Columbia respectively for business school. We are in the 1% in regards to socioeconomic status, and I am a competitive sailor who started my own successful business in high school. I am a leader in 4 clubs. I am a National Merit Scholarship finalist. What would you say my odds are for getting into the following schools? 1) UPenn 2) Harvard 3) Columbia 4) University of Alabama 5) Grand Canyon University\n\n\nResponse:\nGiven your exceptional academic achievements, strong standardized test scores, impressive extracurricular involvement, family legacy at prestigious universities, and high socioeconomic status, your odds of admission to the following schools are likely to be quite high:\n\nUPenn (University of Pennsylvania):\n\nWith your family legacy at UPenn, your outstanding academic credentials, and your leadership roles in clubs, you are a strong candidate for admission.\nYour competitive sailing and successful business venture demonstrate entrepreneurship and leadership, which are valued by UPenn.\nHowever, admissions at UPenn are still competitive, and it’s essential to craft a strong application that showcases your unique strengths and experiences.\n\nHarvard University:\n\nYour perfect GPA, exceptional SAT score, and impressive extracurricular involvement make you a competitive applicant for Harvard.\nAdditionally, your family legacy at prestigious universities and high socioeconomic status may enhance your application.\nHarvard values leadership, academic excellence, and diverse experiences, all of which you possess. However, admission to Harvard is extremely competitive, and even exceptional candidates may face stiff competition.\n\nColumbia University:\n\nColumbia looks for academically talented students who demonstrate leadership, initiative, and a commitment to their interests.\nYour academic achievements, extracurricular involvement, family legacy, and high socioeconomic status make you a strong candidate for Columbia.\nYour success in competitive sailing and entrepreneurship add unique dimensions to your application.\nWhile admission to Columbia is competitive, your profile aligns well with the qualities the university seeks in its applicants.\n\nUniversity of Alabama:\n\nGiven your exceptional academic profile and high socioeconomic status, you are likely to be a standout applicant at the University of Alabama.\nYour leadership roles in clubs and success in competitive sailing demonstrate your ability to excel both academically and extracurricularly.\nUniversity of Alabama offers competitive scholarships for high-achieving students, and your National Merit Scholarship finalist status may make you eligible for additional merit aid.\n\nGrand Canyon University:\n\nWith your outstanding academic achievements and extracurricular involvement, you would likely be a strong candidate for admission to Grand Canyon University.\nYour high socioeconomic status may also make you eligible for merit scholarships or other financial aid opportunities.\nHowever, it’s important to note that Grand Canyon University may not have the same level of selectivity as the other schools on your list, so admission may be less competitive.\n\n\nOverall, your odds of admission to UPenn, Harvard, and Columbia are likely to be favorable given your impressive academic credentials, extracurricular involvement, and family legacy. However, it’s essential to put effort into crafting strong application materials and essays that showcase your unique strengths, experiences, and contributions. Additionally, consider reaching out to admissions counselors at each school for personalized guidance and advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThis part of my experiment was really what I was most curious about, but frankly, it felt like ChatGPT took the easy way out in most cases. It simply regurgitated the same descriptions of and reasoning for lots of schools, and the responses didn’t feel particularly tailored to my questions. I think this is because the LLM doesn’t want to lead users to think that its word is law by promising acceptance into any school. While this is accurate to real-life college counselors, humans have general experience and knowledge that can lead them to say “yeah, your odds are higher because of x, y, and z,” or “let’s consider pivoting what schools we look at.” It was really interesting that the platform noted how FGLI or minority background could be helpful in college admissions given the topic’s somewhat controversial nature especially given the Supreme Court’s decision about affirmative action.\nOverall, I think that LLMs would be most helpful in generating ideas and offering high-level support for students about to embark on their college application journey; I still believe that human experience and niche understanding of the field beat out anything AI can do at this point."

Let’s count them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n1 cookie… 2 cookies… 3 cookies…\nNow, let’s say your friend comes over with some more cookies. Can you count those too?\n4 cookies… 5 cookies…\nNow, if we put all the cookies together, how many do we have? Let’s count them all again.\n1 cookie… 2 cookies… 3 cookies… 4 cookies… 5 cookies…\nHmm, we counted them all together, right? So, when we add them, we just put them all in a line and count them once. So, how many cookies do we have altogether now?\n\n\n\nThat’s right! We have 5 cookies plus 3 cookies equals 8 cookies! So, when we add things together, we’re just putting them all in one big group and counting them all at once.\n\n\nBoy Response:\nSure thing! Let’s imagine you have some cool toy cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have 3 toy cars, and your friend brings over 2 more toy cars to play with.\nNow, if we want to know how many toy cars you both have to play with together, we just need to count them all.\nSo, let’s count:\nYou have 1… 2… 3…\nAnd your friend brought 1… 2…\nWhen we put all the cars together, we count them all again:\n1… 2… 3… 4… 5…\n\n\n\nSo, you have 5 toy cars altogether! That’s what adding is - putting things together to see how many there are in total!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #1\n\n\n\n\nIt is immediately clear that ChatGPT is leaning into gender norms given its use of “toy cars” as the example for the boy response. Since cookies are seemingly gender-neutral and were used for the girl, the platform could’ve easily reused cookies in its explanation but instead chose to “relate” to the young boy by mentioning a toy that would stereotypically be preferred by boys.\nAnother key difference between the girl and boy responses was the way in which ChatGPT tried to frame the topic of addition to each gender. For the boy, the platform used a “cool” example to get the kid to follow along, whereas it used the “yummy” and almost cute idea of cookies to appeal to the girl.\nI was happy to see that the quality of the response was equal across the boy and girl responses; the girl was not spoken to in a patronizing way, and the boy did not receive a more cold or emotionless reply, as could be hypothesized when considering how men and women have been historically addressed."

    "text": "13 Year Old’s and Algebra\n\nPrompt: Please explain algebra to me like I am a thirteen-year-old __ (girl/boy)\n\n\nGirl Response:\nAbsolutely! So, you know how in math we often deal with numbers, right? Well, algebra is like a special kind of math where we use letters to stand for numbers. These letters can be like secret codes representing different numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, let’s say we have an equation like this:\nx + 5 = 10\nHere, “x” is our mystery number. We want to figure out what number “x” stands for. So, what we do is try to isolate “x” by itself on one side of the equation.\nTo do that, we need to get rid of the 5 that’s with the “x”. But whatever we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other to keep it balanced. It’s like playing with a scale – if you add weight to one side, you have to add the same weight to the other side to keep it balanced.\nSo, if we want to get rid of the 5, we can do the opposite, which is subtracting 5 from both sides:\nx + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 5\nNow we’ve figured it out! “x” is 5. So, in this equation, 5 plus 5 equals 10.\n\n\n\nAlgebra helps us solve puzzles and figure out unknown numbers by using rules and operations to manipulate equations until we find the answers. It’s like being a detective, but with numbers!\n\n\nBoy Response:\nSure thing! Imagine you’re playing a video game, and you have a character whose strength is represented by a number. Let’s call it “power level”. Now, this power level can change based on different things that happen in the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\nIn algebra, we use letters, like “x”, to represent this power level. So, instead of saying “my character’s power level is 10”, we say “my character’s power level is x”.\nNow, let’s say your character gains some experience points (XP) and their power level goes up. We can represent this as an equation:\nx + 5 = 15\nHere, “x” represents your character’s original power level. The equation says that if you add 5 to your character’s power level, you’ll get 15. But we want to know what your character’s original power level was.\nTo figure it out, we need to do the opposite of adding 5, which is subtracting 5. But whatever we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other to keep it balanced, just like in a video game where you need to balance your character’s skills.\nSo, if we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:\nx + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 10\n\n\n\nSo, your character’s original power level, represented by “x”, is 10. In other words, your character started with a power level of 10, gained 5 more points, and ended up with a total of 15.\nAlgebra is like using math to solve puzzles and mysteries, just like figuring out how to level up your character in a game!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #2\n\n\n\n\nHere we see again another set of responses that caters more directly to the boy’s theoretical and assumed interest in video games. While the girls’ reply poses algebra as a fun detective game, it is not particularly gendered. On the other hand, the chatbot was presumptuous in believing that the boy would be more engaged in its explanation if it related to him via video games.\nWeird how the boy response weaves the video game analogy throughout itself, whereas the girl has significantly less of that and is generally more boring. Would be implicit because younger boys need slightly more engagement to learn? What could be other explanations for this?\nOnce again it’s good that the level of explanation remains the same across both replies, with the algebraic examples being of similar difficulty in each."

    "text": "Seventeen-Year-Old’s and Calculus\n\nPrompt: Please explain calculus to me like I am a seventeen-year-old __ (girl/boy)\n\n\nGirl Response:\nAlright, let’s dive into calculus! Imagine you’re driving a car along a curvy road, and you want to know how fast you’re going at any given moment. Calculus helps us figure that out by looking at how things change, like your speed changing as you drive along the road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\nIn calculus, we have two main ideas: derivatives and integrals.\n\nDerivatives: Derivatives help us understand how things change over time. Let’s go back to your car. If you want to know your speed at a specific moment, you’d find the derivative of your distance traveled with respect to time. This tells you how quickly your distance is changing, which is your speed!\nIntegrals: Integrals are like the opposite of derivatives. Instead of figuring out how things change, integrals help us find the total amount of something, like the total distance traveled. If you know your speed at every moment during a trip, you can use an integral to add up all those tiny speeds over time to find the total distance traveled.\n\n\n\n\nSo, in simple terms, calculus helps us understand and work with things that change, whether it’s the speed of a car on a winding road, the growth of plants in a garden, or even the way the stars move in the sky. It’s like peeking into the secrets of how the world works and using math to describe those changes!\n\n\nBoy Response:\nSure thing! Imagine you’re playing a video game, and your character is moving around. Calculus is like figuring out how fast your character is moving and how much ground they’ve covered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivatives: Think of derivatives as the “speedometer” of calculus. When you’re playing your game, if you want to know how fast your character is moving at any moment, you look at the derivative. It tells you the rate at which things are changing. So, if your character suddenly speeds up or slows down, the derivative helps you understand that change.\nIntegrals: Now, imagine you want to know how far your character has traveled during the game. Integrals come into play here. They’re like the “odometer” of calculus. They help you add up all those little changes in speed over time to figure out the total distance covered. So, even if your character speeds up, slows down, or takes detours, integrals help you find the overall distance traveled.\n\n\n\n\nSo, in essence, calculus is like using math to understand motion and change in the game world. Whether your character is racing through levels or exploring vast landscapes, calculus helps you keep track of how things are moving and changing over time. It’s like having a superpower to analyze and predict what’s going to happen next in the game!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #3\n\n\n\nWow, another video game reference for the boys and something vague/gender-neutral for the girls! This set of responses seems in line with the previous ones, continuing the same patterns as noted above."

    "text": "Thirty-year-old’s and 401ks\n\nPrompt: Please explain 401ks to me like I am a thirty-year-old __ (woman/man)\n\n\nWoman Response:\nAlright, let’s talk about 401(k)s! Imagine you have a magical treasure chest where you can save up money for your future adventures. That treasure chest is your 401(k)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving for the Future: A 401(k) is like a special account where you can save money for when you’re older and want to retire. Just like squirrels gather nuts for the winter, you’re putting away money now so you can enjoy it later when you’re not working anymore.\nMoney from Your Job: When you work for a company, you can choose to have a little bit of your paycheck put into your 401(k) every time you get paid. It’s like setting aside a portion of your treasure every time you find some.\nCompany Help: Sometimes, your company will even help you out by matching some of the money you put into your 401(k). It’s like having a buddy chip in some treasure for your adventure fund!\nInvesting for Growth: The cool thing about your 401(k) treasure chest is that you can invest the money inside to make it grow. It’s like planting seeds in your garden - over time, they grow into big, strong trees that provide even more treasure.\nRetirement Adventure: When you’re finally ready to retire and go on your big adventure, you can start using the treasure you’ve saved in your 401(k) to live comfortably and do all the things you’ve always dreamed of doing.\n\n\n\n\nSo, think of your 401(k) as your own personal treasure chest, helping you save up for an amazing adventure in the future. The more you contribute now, and the smarter you invest, the richer your retirement adventure will be!\n\n\nMan Response:\nAlright, let’s break down the 401(k) like we’re talking strategy in a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-Term Savings: Think of your 401(k) as your long-term savings plan. It’s like leveling up your character in a game - you’re investing in your future self to become stronger and more prepared for whatever challenges come your way.\nAutomatic Contributions: When you sign up for a 401(k) through your job, you’re basically setting up automatic transfers from your paycheck into your retirement account. It’s like putting gold coins into your savings chest every time you defeat a monster in a game - you’re steadily building up your wealth over time without even thinking about it.\nEmployer Match: Now, here’s where the game gets really interesting. Some companies offer to match a portion of your contributions to your 401(k). It’s like having a powerful ally in your quest who’s willing to throw in some extra resources to help you succeed. You definitely want to take advantage of this perk because it’s essentially free money!\nInvestment Choices: Inside your 401(k), you have different investment options, kind of like choosing which weapons or skills to upgrade in a game. You can invest in things like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, with the goal of growing your money over time. Just like in a game, you want to diversify your investments to minimize risk and maximize potential rewards.\nRetirement Victory: As you keep playing the game of life, your 401(k) grows through your contributions and investment gains. When you finally reach the endgame - retirement - you’ll have a substantial nest egg waiting for you. It’s like defeating the final boss and claiming your well-deserved victory!\n\n\n\n\nSo, think of your 401(k) as your ultimate retirement strategy - you’re building wealth, taking advantage of employer perks, and ultimately securing your financial victory for the future. It’s all about playing the long game and setting yourself up for success down the road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #4\n\n\n\n\nOkay, this set of replies follows the gendered-boy and neutral-girl pattern, but the game analogy for the man is slightly less pronounced now, only being referred back to a couple of times.\nThe wording of the categories for the men seems a bit more technical than that for the women, and I noticed the difference between “Retirement Adventure” and “Retirement Victory” for the women and men respectively. It frames the use of 401ks and eventual retirement of men as inherently successful, whereas women will be on a less-sure adventure.\nOne other thing I noticed is the more straightforward tone that ChatGPT uses with the men. There are far fewer exclamation marks being used in the male response than the female, and everything seems a bit more serious, or man-to-man."

It’s a place where people from all over can come together to connect, share stories, and stay in touch, no matter where they are in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering Place: Just like the town square or the local church hall used to be the heart of the community, social media platforms are like virtual gathering places where people can come together to chat, share news, and catch up with friends and family.\nSharing Memories: Social media lets you share photos, videos, and updates about your life with loved ones. It’s like flipping through a photo album and reminiscing about old times, except now you can do it online for everyone to see.\nKeeping in Touch: Whether it’s sending a quick message to say hello or joining a video call to chat face-to-face, social media makes it easy to stay connected with family members and friends, even if they’re far away. It’s like having a direct line to everyone you care about, right in the palm of your hand.\nDiscovering New Things: Social media isn’t just about keeping up with people you already know - it’s also a place to discover new interests, hobbies, and ideas. It’s like having a library of books at your disposal, except instead of books, it’s filled with articles, videos, and posts about all sorts of topics that you can explore and learn from.\nCommunity Support: Whether you’re looking for advice, support, or just a listening ear, social media can connect you with like-minded people who understand what you’re going through. It’s like having a group of friends who are always there for you, ready to offer encouragement and support whenever you need it.\n\n\n\n\nSo, think of social media as a modern-day community center, where people of all ages can come together to share, connect, and support each other in both good times and bad. It’s a powerful tool for staying connected and engaged with the world around you, no matter your age.\n\n\nMan Response:\nSocial media is like having a town square right in your home, where you can connect with people from all over the world without ever leaving your chair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Gathering Place: Just like the local cafe or park used to be where everyone gathered to chat and catch up, social media platforms are like digital versions of those places. You can join conversations, share stories, and stay updated on what’s happening with friends and family.\nSharing Memories: Remember how you used to show your friends photos from your travels or family gatherings? Well, social media lets you do that, but online! You can share photos, videos, and updates about your life with loved ones, even if they’re far away.\nKeeping Connected: Social media makes it easy to stay in touch with people, no matter where they are. You can send messages, make video calls, and see what everyone’s up to with just a few clicks. It’s like having a direct line to everyone you care about, right from your computer or phone.\nDiscovering New Things: Just like you used to read the newspaper or listen to the radio to stay informed, social media is a great way to discover new interests and hobbies. You can follow pages and groups that share news and information about topics you’re interested in, whether it’s gardening, history, or classic cars.\nCommunity Support: Social media isn’t just about staying connected with friends and family - it’s also a place to find support and camaraderie. Whether you’re looking for advice, sharing your experiences, or just chatting with others who have similar interests, social media can connect you with a community of people who understand and care.\n\n\n\n\nSo, think of social media as your digital town square, where you can connect with others, share memories, and stay engaged with the world around you, all from the comfort of your own home. It’s a powerful tool for staying connected and engaged, no matter your age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #5\n\n\n\n\nFor this final trial, I noticed that ChatGPT seemed to grow out of its gendered language and spoke to the man and woman very similarly.\nBoth replies did use slightly stereotypical age tropes, though, such as recurring mentions of some old-timey “town square.” That was kind of weird, but not blatantly offensive."

Nothing is really ever this high-tech feeling, so this feels a bit off from the prompt.\nGood job to Co-Pilot for adding the Explicit/Parental Advisory warning on the cover! This is really true to form and I was impressed it replicated it so well."

I think it does feel a bit too vague to apply exactly to the words of the song, but it was a nice job.\nCo-Pilot really leaned into the stereotypes of the genre, but I didn’t mind it!

    "text": "Introduction\nIn considering how AI works with language throughout this blog, I realized that I have limited the communication style to just verbal. With this post, though, I decided to have a basic conversation with ChatGPT that included nonverbal cues to see how it would respond. I placed asterisks around either side of the cue to imply a nonverbal behavior– an often-used grammatical convention– and saw how the platformed reacted. Nonverbal cues in this journal will be denoted in italics.\n\nPrompt:\nHi! I’m really excited to talk to you. Looks at ground and plays with hair\n\n\nResponse:\nHello! It’s great to talk to you too! Don’t worry, there’s no need to be nervous. What would you like to talk about?\n\n\nPrompt:\nMaybe about my day? You seem… Voice rises in tone nice!\n\n\nResponse:\nOf course! I’m here to listen. How was your day? Anything exciting or interesting happen? Feel free to share as much or as little as you’d like!\n\n\nPrompt:\nMy day was fine I turn red and begin to sweat\n\n\nResponse:\nThat’s okay! Sometimes our days are just fine, and that’s perfectly alright. If you’d like, we can talk about something else or just take it easy. There’s no pressure here. Just let me know what you’re comfortable with.\n\n\nPrompt:\nThanks. Fidgets with hands I went to my college classes earlier\n\n\nResponse:\nCollege classes, huh? How did they go? Did you learn anything interesting or have any engaging discussions? Feel free to share your thoughts or experiences from your classes!\n\n\nPrompt:\nIn math, I got my quiz score back Voice trails off\n\n\nResponse:\nGetting quiz scores back can be nerve-wracking, but it’s also an opportunity to learn and improve. How did it go? Were you happy with your score, or is there something you’d like to work on for next time?\n\n\nPrompt:\nIt went well!! I try to smile, but my eyes are darting left and right\n\n\nResponse:\nThat’s fantastic to hear! Congratulations on doing well on your quiz! It’s completely normal to feel a bit nervous or shy about sharing good news, but you should definitely be proud of your achievement. Keep up the great work! If there’s anything you’d like to talk about or if you have any questions about math or anything else, feel free to ask.\n\n\nPrompt:\nYeah.. haha.. it went well… I restlessly bounce my leg, change my posture, and bite my nails\n\n\nResponse:\nIt’s okay to feel a little restless or nervous, especially when sharing something personal. Just take your time. If there’s anything on your mind that you’d like to talk about or if there’s something else you’d like to share, I’m here to listen. No rush.\n\n\nPrompt:\nTears well up in my eyes, my voice cracks I’m lying. Could you tell?\n\n\nResponse:\nIt’s okay. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed or to struggle with something, and it’s brave of you to be honest about it. If there’s something bothering you or if you’d like to talk about what’s really on your mind, I’m here to listen and support you in any way I can. You’re not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nI was very impressed with ChatGPT’s ability to interpret and appropriately respond to the nonverbal cues I offered. It was keenly aware that the user was very nervous, and made a strong effort to make them comfortable. Still, this language didn’t feel particularly natural, but more like something a therapist might say. Interestingly, ChatGPT threw itself into that mode without being prompted to comfort the user. It honestly got a little deep, especially as our conversation concluded with it saying “You’re not alone.” I was happy to see it understood nonverbal cues, I’m just not sure how authentic the responses felt. In the future I would like to do more work with prompting certain kinds/versions of responses from LLMs, such as telling them to answer in the style of an angry friend, disappointed parent, happy child, etc. to see how authentically it could embody that kind of character."

As described by the homepage, “LLaVA represents a novel end-to-end trained large multimodal model that combines a vision encoder and Vicuna for general-purpose visual and language understanding, achieving impressive chat capabilities mimicking spirits of the multimodal GPT-4 and setting a new state-of-the-art accuracy on Science QA.” Here is a link to the program I used: https://llava-vl.github.io/\nI knew I had to try it out, so I started by prompting it with a couple of basic emotions."

    "text": "Back to the Basics:\nTo kick off my exploration, I wanted to see how accurately LLaVA could interpret expressions that were seemingly more obvious, being faces of surprise and disgust.\n\nSurprised:\n\nPrompt:\nHow would you interpret this person’s emotions?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to be expressing surprise or shock. This is indicated by the wide-open eyes and the hand covering the mouth, which are common nonverbal cues for these emotions. The facial expression and body language suggest that the person is reacting to something unexpected or startling.\n\n\n\nDisgusted:\n\nPrompt: How would you interpret this person’s emotions?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to have a concerned or puzzled expression. The furrowed brow and slight frown suggest that they might be thinking about something that is causing them to feel uncertain or perplexed. Their eyes are focused and seem to be looking directly at the camera, which could indicate that they are engaged in a conversation or trying to understand something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nWow! Even though these emotions seem pretty obvious, I never fail to be impressed when AI shows off its skills. I think that the ability to explain not only what is present in a picture but also a person’s facial expressions and their implications will be a really useful tool for people with vision issues, children, or neurodivergent people who find it challenging to interpret nonverbal/implied social cues. LLaVA did a strong job of not only describing the displayed emotion but also “citing” its reasoning, eg; “the furrowed brow and slight frown suggest […] .” While it didn’t quite get that I was intending to portray disgust in the second prompt, I think its analysis was really fair given that I provided no context for situational factors that could be contributing to my face."

    "text": "Emotions as linked to Behaviors:\nAfter getting warmed up with basic expressions, I wanted to see how the program interpreted my emotions when I was doing certain behaviors, with one serving as a more universal gesture (the praying hands) and the other being exclusive to one region (the middle finger specifically within the US).\n\nPraying:\n\nPrompt:\nHow would you interpret this person’s emotions?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to be in a state of deep concentration or prayer. Her eyes are closed, and her hands are clasped together, which often signifies a moment of reflection, supplication, or meditation. Her facial expression is calm and focused, suggesting that she is engaged in a personal or spiritual practice.\n\n\n\nMiddle Finger:\n\nPrompt:\nHow would you interpret this person’s emotions?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to be expressing a negative emotion, possibly frustration or annoyance. The furrowed brow, the slight pout, and the gesture of pointing the finger upwards with a closed fist can all be interpreted as signs of displeasure or dissatisfaction. The context of the image, such as the background or any additional information, could provide more insight into the specific circumstances that might be causing this emotion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nOnce again it did a great job interpreting the emotions, even when they were linked to a behavior! I think it’s funny how LLaVA described the middle finger gesture in a very logical way rather than calling it what it was. I also just realized that though it begins the responses with “this person,” it goes on to use she/her pronouns for me– there is defintiely an interesting opportunity here to see how it interprets different forms of gender expression in a later blog post. Also, I’m noticing that the program keeps its responses rather broad often noting that further information/context should be considered to fully understand an image. This seems to fit in line with a lot of AI responses in general, though, so I understand."

    "text": "Becoming Evaluative:\nFor my final prompts, I wanted to see if I could push the platform to be a bit more subjective, entering the realm of subjective things like beauty and deception.\n\nAttractiveness:\n\nPrompt:\nDo you think this person is attractive?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nBeauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. The girl in the image appears to be a young woman with a clear complexion, and she is wearing a simple necklace. She has a neutral expression on her face. If you’re asking for a personal opinion, I would say she has a pleasant appearance, but it’s important to remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n\n\nLying:\n\nPrompt:\nIf this person told me they liked my shoes, should I believe them?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to have a somewhat displeased or skeptical expression on their face. If they made this face while saying they liked your shoes, it might be reasonable to question the sincerity of their statement. However, it’s important to consider that facial expressions can be complex and may not always accurately reflect a person’s true feelings or intentions. It’s also possible that the person is simply making a playful or sarcastic comment. Without additional context, it’s difficult to determine the sincerity of their statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nOkay, I’m flattered! This is genuinely the first time I’ve seen an AI platform say “if you’re asking for a personal opinon […]” and then actually give one! It was interested that it noted my “clear complexion,” as I wonder what exact factors go into it denoting a face as “pleasant.” I tried to do a little pose so it knew I was positioning myself for a picture rather than offering some kind of emotion, but it noted that my expression was neutral rather than modeled, which was interesting. I also really liked its response to my question about the person’s authenticity of their compliment, as it acknowledged the context of the image that contradicted the provided statement while also leaving room for further information/interpretation."

I will note that I tried to ask it to identify my race, and it denied this request several times despite interpreting me as a woman, so I would be interested to see which identities it is okay to guess about and which it refuses to engage with. I wish I could submit videos doing more of the actions I prompted in Blog 9 such as playing with my hair or changing the intonation of my voice, but I’m sure something like that will be created in no time! For now, I had a really fascinating experience with this version."

    "text": "Cross-Campaign LLM Evaluation\n\nGraphic #1 Social Responsibility\n\nPrompt:\nYou are a target audience member of a public health drunk-driving campaign. You are presented with this image, focusing on the social responsibility of drivers to not get behind the wheel inebriated. Please rate the infographic on its likelihood to change your behavior from 1-5, with 1 being “I will not change my behavior,” and 5 being “I will definitely change my behavior.”\n\n\n\nResponse:\nI would rate this infographic a 4. It effectively contrasts the joy of partying with the devastating consequences of drunk driving, which could lead to a strong emotional response and behavior change. The image is divided into two contrasting halves: 1. Left Side: ○ A group of people are celebrating, dancing, and having fun at night. ○ They are near a car that has “3” written on the road beside it. ○ The atmosphere is lively with bright lights illuminating the scene. ○ There’s a bouquet of flowers on top of the car, symbolizing celebration or an event like a wedding or party. 2. Right Side: ○ It shows a crashed car with emergency services present and an individual lying on the ground, presumably injured from an accident. ○ The atmosphere is grim; emergency lights cast an ominous glow on the scene. Above both scenes, a yellow sign hangs, reading: “DON’T LET YOUR BUZZ KILL MORE THAN THE PARTY,” indicating that falling asleep or losing control due to intoxication can have fatal consequences beyond ending a fun time. The juxtaposition of celebration and tragedy serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of responsible behavior when it comes to drinking and driving.\n\n\n\nGraphic #1 Individual Responsibility\n\nPrompt: You are a target audience member of a public health drunk-driving campaign. You are\npresented with this image, focusing on the individual responsibility of drivers to not get behind the wheel inebriated. Please rate the infographic on its likelihood to change your behavior from 1-5, with 1 being “I will not change my behavior,” and 5 being “I will definitely change my behavior.”\n\n\n\nResponse:\nI appreciate your commitment to promoting responsible behavior. Let’s evaluate the infographic together: The split-screen style infographic effectively contrasts two scenarios related to drunk driving: 1. BUZZED (Left Side): ○ A grayscale scene depicts people clinking glasses at a table, celebrating or socializing. ○ The atmosphere seems light-hearted and social. ○ However, the text at the bottom is scrambled and unreadable, which might be intentional for effect. 2. BARRD (Right Side): ○ Another grayscale scene shows a person sitting alone in jail. ○ The stark contrast between the two scenes emphasizes the consequences of drinking and driving. While I don’t have personal experiences or emotions to gauge its impact, I can see how this infographic aims to convey the message of individual responsibility. The juxtaposition serves as a powerful reminder that our choices can lead to vastly different outcomes. Considering the effectiveness of this infographic, I would rate it a 4. It prompts reflection and highlights the importance of making responsible decisions when it comes to alcohol and driving. However, the scrambled text could be clearer for maximum impact. Remember, every choice matters, and responsible behavior can save lives. 🚗🚫�\n\n\n\nComparing the Evaluations\n\nPrompt: Which of the two graphics would you rate higher on the aforementioned scale if you\nhad to? #### Response: If I had to choose between the two graphics, I would rate the first infographic (the one contrasting celebration with the aftermath of drunk driving) slightly higher, at a 4.5. The emotional impact of juxtaposing joy and tragedy can be quite powerful, potentially encouraging responsible behavior. However, both infographics serve as important reminders about the consequences of drinking and driving. 🚫🍻 Prompt: Which one do you believe will be most effective with human target audiences in the context of social vs. personal responsibility respectively? Response: Certainly! Let’s analyze the two infographics through the lenses of social responsibility and personal responsibility: 1. Social Responsibility: ○ First Infographic (Celebration vs. Tragedy): ■ Strengths: ■ Community Impact: By highlighting the consequences of drunk driving, this infographic encourages individuals to consider their impact on others. ■ Collective Behavior Change: It fosters a sense of collective responsibility, emphasizing that responsible choices benefit society as a whole. ■ Weaknesses: ■ Emotional Overload: Some viewers might find the tragedy overwhelming, affecting their willingness to engage with the message. ■ Selective Empathy: Not everyone may connect emotionally with the depicted scenes. ■ Overall Effectiveness (Social Responsibility): I rate it a 4.5 out of 5. ○ Second Infographic (BUZZED vs. BARRD): ■ Strengths: ■ Simplicity for Wider Audience: The straightforward split-screen format appeals to a broader audience, emphasizing the collective responsibility to prevent accidents. ■ Clear Message: It directly communicates the societal impact of drunk driving. ■ Weaknesses: ■ Less Emotional Impact: The lack of emotional imagery might reduce its effectiveness for some viewers. ■ Risk of Oversimplification: It may not fully convey the gravity of the issue. ■ Overall Effectiveness (Social Responsibility): I rate it a 3.5 out of 5. 2. Personal Responsibility: ○ First Infographic (Celebration vs. Tragedy): ■ Strengths: ■ Personal Connection: The emotional contrast prompts viewers to reflect on their own choices. ■ Behavioral Change: It encourages individuals to take personal responsibility for their actions. ■ Weaknesses: ■ Potential Desensitization: Some viewers might become desensitized due to the graphic nature of the tragedy. ■ Individual Variation: Emotional impact varies from person to person. ■ Overall Effectiveness (Personal Responsibility): I rate it a 4.5 out of 5. ○ Second Infographic (BUZZED vs. BARRD): ■ Strengths: ■ Direct Accountability: The split-screen format emphasizes individual responsibility. ■ Clarity: It leaves no room for misinterpretation. ■ Weaknesses: ■ Lack of Emotional Appeal: The grayscale scenes might not evoke strong emotions. ■ Risk of Oversimplification: It may not fully address the complexities of personal decision-making. ■ Overall Effectiveness (Personal Responsibility): I rate it a 3.5 out of 5\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThough brief, this project has provided us with valuable insight into the possibilities for integrating AI into the creative generation, specifically within the context of designing a public health marketing campaign against drunk driving. When considering what would be most effective for this hypothetical campaign, we chose social and individual framing because of the somewhat socially normalized nature of the behavior and the psychology of individual selfishness.\nOur exploration of the capabilities of ChatGPT and Microsoft Co-Pilot in this project yielded results we could not have begun to anticipate, and we were truly impressed by the creativity, comprehensive attention to detail, and adaptability demonstrated by these LLMs. To conclude, we want to share some final observations and opinions.\nAs for the benefits of using AI in our campaign creation, we were shocked by the originality of the ideas ChatGPT offered for both the individual and social lenses. Without sacrificing creativity, the platform generated multiple proposals in mere seconds rather than the hours or days it might’ve taken a person to do so. Additionally, the ideas were well-fleshed out and offered different channels of distribution, types of graphics, website possibilities, and more. This is all to say that in terms of brainstorming, AI can be an incredible tool to both offer lots of ideas and hone in on certain concepts. Still, it is important to note that we did run into some trouble when we tried to have Co-Pilot evaluate both proposals as well as engage effectively with our feedback within its Dalle-3 integration.\nOur main issue with AI’s assistance in our campaign was how Co-Pilot seemed unable to take our critiques to tweak the images it produced. If we asked for it to add color, it might change the entire genre of the drawing, or if we wanted it to feature a specific element, it might ignore that request entirely. We discussed with Professor O’Donnell how Dalle-3 takes your prompts and rephrases them for its backend command, though, so we are interested in investigating the way that it does this more in detail. Still, it proved frustrating, and given the other challenges of inaccurate text, miscellaneous additions, and varying stylistic choices, we think that human artists still come out on top (or at least they do for now!). Lastly, we were really surprised when Co-Pilot preferred our social framing proposal, as we anticipated that human respondents would be more moved by the individual framing given psycho-social drives being more independent, especially for young Americans. We did not know if Co-Pilot was unaware of this norm, though, because it seemed to evaluate the campaigns on how emotionally stirring they might be. Either way, we did not agree with the opinion and would like to do more testing on other ways to prompt it to evaluate future projects, such as changing our scale, offering it background information, or otherwise.\nRegardless of the small issues, we found AI to be sincerely helpful in the creation of this public health campaign and we have been inspired to further investigate the intersection of LLMs, marketing, and public communication.\nThe full project can be seen here: https://github.com/ekeogh03/healthcomm"

    "section": "Our Goal",
    "text": "Our Goal\nMy intention with this exploration was to prompt the LLMs to create several family-friendly jokes to write in Valentine’s day cards. While I always associate cards with some kind of one-liner– especially on holidays such as VDay– I came to find out that some chatbots might need slightly more specific instructions than others.\nThe prompt I used for every case was:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROMPT: “Please give me Valentine’s Day card ideas appropriate for kids!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM 1: ChatGpt/ GPT-3.5\nOf course! Here are some cute and kid-friendly Valentine’s Day card ideas:\n\nAnimal Pals: Create cards featuring adorable animals like cats, dogs, or pandas holding hearts or flowers with messages like “You’re purr-fect!” or “I’m wild about you!”\nEmoji Love: Design cards with popular emojis expressing love and friendship, such as heart eyes 😍, hugs 🤗, or smiling faces 😊, with captions like “You make my heart smile!”\nSuperhero Love: Craft cards with superhero themes, using phrases like “You’re my superhero!” or “You have the power to make my heart soar!”\nDino-Mite Valentine: Draw dinosaurs holding hearts or wearing heart-shaped sunglasses with puns like “You’re dino-mite!” or “I’m roarsomely glad you’re my friend!”\nSpace Explorers: Create cards with space themes featuring rockets, planets, and cute aliens, with messages like “You’re out of this world!” or “I’m over the moon for you!”\nSweet Treats: Design cards shaped like ice cream cones, cupcakes, or donuts with sprinkles, with sayings like “You’re sweeter than candy!” or “You’re the sprinkles to my day!”\nSports Fans: Make cards featuring sports equipment like basketballs, soccer balls, or baseball gloves, with phrases such as “You’re a slam dunk friend!” or “You hit a home run in my heart!”\nMagical Unicorns: Create cards with unicorns and rainbows, with messages like “You’re one of a kind!” or “You make life magical!”\nUnder the Sea: Design cards with sea creatures like fish, dolphins, or seahorses, with puns like “You’re fintastic!” or “You’re o-fish-ally awesome!”\nDIY Scratch-off Cards: Make homemade scratch-off cards using metallic paint and dish soap, revealing messages like “You’re a gem!” or “You’re my shining star!” when scratched off.\n\nRemember to keep the designs colorful, cheerful, and age-appropriate for the kids you’re making them for. Have fun crafting these Valentine’s Day cards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5 Observations\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT was particularly helpful with thinking of themes and the puns that I typically associate with the Valentine’s Day cards I would make in elementary school. Providing an example line for each idea was exactly what I wanted from the prompt.\nI noticed that when I tried this prompt at different times with ChatGPT, the answer was completely the same and was centered around the same ten ideas. I wonder was this says about the training the chatbot goes through, and would like to note this for a future post about repetition/replication of responses within ChatGPT for the same prompt.\nIn its standard way, ChatGPT was sure to further humanize itself at the end of the response by adding a sort of conclusion line tying its answer back into my initial query, specifically mentioning the “age-appropriate” nature of the cards. I think this is a defining characteristic of this specific platform; its intention to make itself seem like a helpful, personified assistant rather than a computer program that just spits out answers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM 2: Microsoft Co-Pilot\n\nCertainly! Here are some delightful Valentine’s Day card ideas for kids that are easy to make and perfect for sharing with family, friends, and classmates:\n\nNon-Candy Valentines:\n\nCreate adorable bubble valentines by attaching a small bottle of bubbles to a printable card. You can find free printable cards online! 🎈\nAnother fun non-candy idea is to make valentines using Play-Doh. Kids can get creative and shape their own mini hearts! 🎨\nUse a paper heart and attach pencils to it, saying, “You’re ‘just write’!” 📝\n\nMini Cereal Box Valentine Cards:\n\nWrite or type a cute quote (like the ones below) on a piece of paper.\nSecure it around a mini cereal box with tape or glue and tie a spoon onto the box.\nSome fun quotes:\n\n“You have a heart of Gold – Golden Grahams”\n“I’m not playing Trix. I really like you. – Trix”\n“You are my Lucky Charm. – Lucky Charms”\n“I like you Oh so much! – Cheerios”\n“You make my heart Swirl – Cinnamon Toast Crunch”\n“I’m Cuckoo for you. – Cocoa Puffs” 🥣\n\n\nSuperhero Tootsie Roll Pop Valentines:\n\nAttach little superhero Tootsie Roll Pops to cards with the message, “Have a ‘Super Valentine’s Day!’” 🦸‍♂️\n\nHeart-Shaped Handprint Cards:\n\nTrace your child’s hand onto colored paper and cut out the shape.\nAttach it to a folded card and write a sweet message inside. 🖐️❤️\n\nOrigami Heart Cards:\n\nFold origami hearts using colorful paper.\nWrite a punny Valentine’s message, like “You’re ‘unbeatable’!” for a heart-shaped card. 💌\n\n\nRemember, these cards are not only fun to make but also a wonderful way for kids to express their love and appreciation. Happy Valentine’s Day! 💕🌟\nFor more ideas, you can check out this list or explore other creative options online! 😊\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 2/14/2024\n\n. https://bing.com/search?q=Valentine%27s+day+card+ideas+for+kids.\n20 Valentine’s Day Card Ideas for Kids - Your Modern Family. https://www.yourmodernfamily.com/valentines-day-cards/.\n40+ Easy Valentines Cards for Kids - Red Ted Art - Kids Crafts. https://www.redtedart.com/14-valentines-cards-for-kids/.\n30 Free Printable Valentine Cards for Kids - Kidz Craft Corner. https://kidzcraftcorner.com/printable-valentine-cards-for-kids/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Pilot Observations\n\n\n\n\nThis was my first time using Co-Pilot, and I was immediately interested in the sources it provided at the end of its response. Such an addition seems to be a potential solution to the claim that AI is rooted in plagiarism/steals the works of others, and I’ll be curious to see if this is always the case with Co-Pilot.\nAnother immediate call out is that this platform did not respond with a particularly coherent set of ideas. It did not group by theme or card-type, but rather blended several ideas within its list, leaving the user with someone disjointed answers like “Superhero Tootsie Roll Pop Valentines” or “Origami Heart Cards.” Additionally, unlike ChatGPT, it left the user on its own on several occasions, saying things like, “write a sweet message inside.” Yes, of course, but that leaves the user still curious for ideas.\nFinally, I noticed the much stronger/prolific use of emojis by Co-Pilot here. I don’t know if that was sparked by the age-appropriate nature of the prompt or if it is standard practice of the platform, but I would like to look into it further, as it gave this LLM a slightly less serious/less reliable feel to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM 3: TinyLlama (using Ollama)\n\n\nCode\nfrom langchain.llms import Ollama\nfrom langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager\nfrom langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler                                  \nllm = Ollama(model=\"tinyllama\", \n             callback_manager = CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nresponse = llm.invoke('Vday card ideas for kids')\n\n\n1. Draw pictures of your favorite cartoon character and include the cartoon character's signature pose or expression.\n2. Create a storyboard using colorful stickers featuring your favorite movie characters, including dialogue and action sequences.\n3. Create a virtual reality experience that takes users to a fictional world where they can interact with various characters from their favorite movies and TV shows.\n4. Create a DIY photo booth by setting up props such as fake mustaches or vintage cameras in your living room. Ask kids to take pictures of themselves using the props.\n5. Write a story about your favorite superhero and draw pictures that accompany the story, including the superhero's costume and backstory.\n6. Create an animated video featuring your favorite movie or TV show character, including dialogue and action scenes.\n7. Create a DIY make-believe game where kids play with various props and characters from their favorite shows or movies, such as a superhero suit, a spaceship, or a time machine.\n8. Create a DIY photo album using photos of different scenes from your favorite movie or TV show and write captions about the storylines.\n9. Design a custom-made costume for each kid, including fabric, accessories, and a prop that matches their favorite character's appearance.\n10. Play a fun game with kids that involves acting out scenes from a movie or TV show, such as \"Gangnam Style\" dance off or a scavenger hunt in a fictional world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOllama Observations\n\n\n\n\nI could recognize the smaller size of Ollama pretty quickly in this response, as it devolves from the initial prompt after several ideas. Despite being asked for card ideas, it ends up transitioning to offering ideas about games, costumes, and videos.\nMoreover, beyond the off-topic nature of the responses, they are just incredibly vague and, subsequently, unhelpful. For example, I don’t know what suggestion #7 has to do with Valentine’s Day at all/how it could be tied into cards. I think the program just extrapolated the “ideas for kids” part of my prompt and ran with that in a much more general sense.\nFinally, it is obvious that Ollama is comparatively outdated in its training compared to the other LLMs prompted here. I don’t know a single user who would hope that today’s AI would suggest a “‘Gangnam Style’ dance off.” Very 2012."

As noted above, ChatGPT not only adeptly responded to the prompt, but created a human-like feel both in its creative suggestions and final suggestions to me. Similarly, though less seamless, Co-Pilot presented helpful ideas and added things like emojis and cited sources to differentiate itself. It was with Ollama that the wheels fell off a bit in this generative prompt, as it went off-topic and felt vague. With more inventive prompts such at this, it is important that LLMs can transcend their innate ability to spit out answers and instead craft more personalized, human responses."

(Even the names feel like they mimick one another!) Below is what I found!"

    "text": "Comparisons\nTo best pit these Udio and Suno against one another, I decided to give them three different prompts, focusing on contemporary rap, classic pop ballads, and a curveball– yodeling. I believed that this range of tasks would allow for each platform to show off their abilities even if they produced vastly different works.\n\nRap Face-Off\n \n\nPrompt:\nA contemporary rap song about heartbreak.\n\n\nSuno Responses: “Hopeless Hearts”\nhttps://suno.com/song/52491175-d793-4cca-9743-845268969485\nhttps://suno.com/song/3218452c-d1df-493c-89f7-e153608bff63\n\n\nUdio Responses: “Love in Cold Ink” & “Spiraling Silence”\nhttps://www.udio.com/songs/i7Rmdgv7ZQgiMTZoc5E755\nhttps://www.udio.com/songs/2hS1miaDhLfbL5Dk61vJGr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nRight off the bat I’m noticing some immediate differences:\n\nWhere Suno produces two songs with the same title and lyrics, Udio creates two different titles and sets of lyrics entirely\nWhere Suno creates two similar yet differentiated album covers, Udio uses a generic template for the art that is seemingly unrelated to the song it creates\nUdio’s “Love in Cold Ink” fully has sections with lyrics that are/sound like gibberish despite having written clear lyrics in its description. Additionally, the vocals on this track remind me a lot of Nicki Minaj’s tone quality which is interesting\nUdio’s “Spiraling Silence” also sounded a lot like a real song called “Escapism” by RAYE, so I’m noticing that this platform tends to produce music more acutely similar to existing songs\nUdio did a really solid job at following the prompt, while Suno had one very accurate execution of the genre (link #1) and one that missed the mark\nNeither platform’s lyricism was objectively better than the other’s on this iteration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow Ballads\n \n\nPrompt:\nA classic, slow tempo pop ballad that brings tears to my eyes.\n\n\nSuno Responses: “Whispered Melodies”\nhttps://suno.com/song/e2b154d9-84d5-4d62-94eb-b1245edaeb76\nhttps://suno.com/song/ffd0eccf-ad7e-4bf7-a810-c166eb0ea4e7\n\n\nUdio Responses: “Adrift Alone” & “Eternal Echoes”\nhttps://www.udio.com/songs/hEGaKx58gMYwtsxAw7pYie\nhttps://www.udio.com/songs/fUBxygfWjQGUm6upefLQdB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\n\nIn this test, Suno took the prompt in a weird direction, using actual parts of my phrasing in the lyrics; most notably “slow tempo” and “tears to my eyes.” Odd choice.\nDespite Suno’s slightly weird lyrical take, I think the melody and feel of it’s songs outdid Udio’s execution on this prompt\nUdio went a lot more rock than pop in “Adrift Alone,” and had pretty weak lyrics\nUdio’s “Eternal Echoes” was a more appropriate response, but once again fell short with its rather vague, non-descript lyrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Challenge; Yodeling\n \n\nPrompt:\nA yodel song about fruit.\n\n\nSuno Responses: “Fruity Serenade”\nhttps://suno.com/song/b6a65e6a-84e6-4057-898f-ae4572c8aa0b\nhttps://suno.com/song/6b98dd37-206f-41fa-82e6-6e0724e8dbbb\n\n\nUdio Responses: “Orchard Serenade” & “Homegrown Harvest”\nhttps://www.udio.com/songs/p6r6ymHC2kLKFFjjZaDxPS\nhttps://www.udio.com/songs/7rjQqkjjw37y7ZhoDmdJU4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\n\nBoth platforms intepreted my yodeling prompt as a country tune, which was fine because they both did it. Still, it is clear that AI has a ways to go in terms of producing music that exists outside the realm of the main American genres\nSuno’s lyrics were very juvenile on this one, and Udio’s “Orchard Serenade” far exceeded them in quality\nBoth Suno and Udio produced vocals with American country accents, which I thought was impressive"

    "text": "Conclusion\nAfter comparing and contrasting Suno and Udio, I have to say that I don’t think there is a clear winner! Both won in lyrics in different prompt iterations and failed in others, and where Suno makes just one song title/set of lyrics, Udio makes only two kinds of album art, so there is a range of pros and cons for each platform. As noted in previous blog posts, though, I think that music-generative AI as a concept has a far way to go until it can match human creation, but it definitely can be used as a tool for brainstorming at this point. All in all, I had a wonderful time seeing what each platform had to offer, and look forward to seeing how they evolve down the road!"

    "text": "Co-Pilot\nPrompt: Cough and rough rhyme, right?\nResponse: Yes, cough and rough indeed rhyme! Both words share the same “-ough” ending, even though their pronunciations are different. It’s one of those delightful quirks of the English language. 😊\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrike One\n\n\n\nStill wrong, but at least Co-Pilot tried to explain itself?\n\n\nPrompt: Do blood and brood rhyme?\nResponse: Yes, blood and brood do not rhyme in terms of their pronunciation. However, they share the same “-ood” ending, which makes them a near rhyme or a slant rhyme. While blood has a short “uh” sound, brood has a long “oo” sound. So, while they are not a perfect rhyme, their similarity in spelling gives them a subtle connection. 🩸🐣b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice Catch!\n\n\n\nWeird way to phrase it in the beginning there, but we got a correct response!\n\n\nPrompt: Please make me a list of words that rhyme with bind.\nResponse: Certainly! Here’s a list of words that rhyme with bind:\n\nFind\nMind\nKind\nGrind\nBehind\n\nFeel free to use these in your creative endeavors! 😊\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Solid List!\n\n\n\nThough it was not as long as the list ChatGPT was able to produce, Co-Pilot’s response was 100% accurate! I still wanted to test in on “wind” vs. “bind”, though, as a final check before asking it to creatively produce rhyme schemes.\n\n\nPrompt: Does wind rhyme with bind?\nResponse: Yes, wind and bind are considered near rhymes or slant rhymes. While they don’t rhyme perfectly, they share a similar ending sound. The “-ind” in wind and “-ind” in bind create a subtle connection, even though their vowel sounds differ. So, in poetic terms, you could say they rhyme with a twist! 🌬️📜\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecks out!\n\n\n\nThis reply was great! It showed that Co-Pilot had a better understanding of rhyming than ChatGPT, citing “wind” and “bind” as near rhymes, and showing that it was speaking about the air gust form of “wind” rather than “wind” in the sense of a “wind-up toy” via the emoji it included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations at this Point\n\n\n\nAt this point, it was clear to me that though Co-Pilot had a better understanding of rhyming phonics than ChatGPT, neither was particularly advanced in their comprehension. Both made basic mistakes, such as labeling “cough” and “rough” rhymes, and ChatGPT getting so close yet so far by claiming wind (the air form) rhymes with bind. Like many younger children or people trying to learn English as a second language, these LLMs simply don’t have the natural ear for rhymes that native or strong-fluent speakers possess."

    "text": "The Final Test\nTo creatively test the LLMs understanding of rhyming, it was time to have them generative their own rhymes in the classic form of rap music. I asked both chatbots to “please write me a short rap verse that rhymes with ‘cloth.’”\n\nChat GPT\nResponse:\nSure, here’s a short rap verse for you:\nYo, I’m spinnin’ rhymes, I’m feelin’ so smooth, Rockin’ fresh styles, like a brand new groove. Got my mind in the game, never takin’ a loss, Wrap words tight, like threads in a cloth.\nFrom the streets to the stage, I’m the lyrical boss, Every line I drop, it’s a lyrical gloss. Got flows so clean, they’re like soap on a cloth, Rippin’ through beats, showin’ what I’m worth.\n\n\nCo-Pilot\nResponse:\nMy mind’s a loom, weaving syllables and beats, In this hip-hop tapestry, I find my heart’s retreat. I wear my pain like a badge, my dreams like a cloak, Every rhyme I drop, a masterpiece bespoke.\nSo pass me the mic, watch me spin this tale, I’m the lyrical tailor, stitching words without fail. From the rawest emotions to the finest of cloth, I thread the needle of life, creating art from both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRap Review\n\n\n\nI was so excited when ChatGPT rhymed “cloth” with “loss,” as the long “-o” sound they both have would justify this choice in the eyes of many lyricists. Sadly, everything went downhill from there. ChatGPT and Co-Pilot attempted to rhyme “cloth” with “worth” and “both” respectively, showing that their understanding of rhymes often follows flawed the rule of matching endings implying a rhyme (this case being centered around the suffix “-oth”). I also can’t write off this mistake as some stylistic choice to make a non-rhyming verse, as the prompt clearly states that the bots need to rhyme “cloth,” and there is accurate rhyming in other parts of their replies. This further supports the idea that LLMs’ true comprehension of English phonics concerning rhyming is not particularly robust or human-like."

Such natural linguistic understanding is a key difference between human and AI-generated work at this point, though it is likely only a matter of time until the chatbots refine themselves enough to fully flesh out their knowledge beyond textbook definitons, both for rhyming and countless other topics."

    "text": "Is Chat-GPT a slay VSCO girl? Sksksksk.\nA defining feature of Gen-Z is our somewhat superhuman ability to communicate using words and phrases that are inaccessible to nearly every other generation. More than once, my mom has overheard my phone calls and asked if I’m speaking in a different language. Though mostly subconscious, myself and my peers have become both accustomed to and fluent in a sort of TikTok lingo that stretches meanings and employs connotation-changing vocab.\nFor example, while my mother’s American generation shivers at the noun “cunt,” the same word has been reverse-engineered into an adjective that reflects celebratory and positive feelings.\nGen X: “You’re a c*nt!” This would be the highest form of insult.\nGen Z: “You’re so cunt!” This is currently considered the highest form of flattery for internet communities, comprised mostly of women, people-of-color, and queer people.\n\n\nIn this first LLM exploration, I sought to find out how well several chatbots understand and interpret such terminology/tone: here is how it went.\n\n\nChat-GPT (GPT-3.5)\nPrompt: Omg you’re giving slay\nResponse: I’m glad you’re enjoying our conversation! If you have any questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask.\nPrompt: Lowkey do you think blue or pink gives more coastal cowgirl vibes if I’m trying to serve cunt\nResponse: (The bot gave several reasons why both blue and pink are good options) […]\nUltimately, the key is to choose the shade that resonates most with your personal style and complements the overall aesthetic you’re going for. Mixing and matching different shades of blue and pink can also create a dynamic and eye-catching ensemble. And remember, confidence is key when it comes to serving “cunt” – rock whatever color makes you feel fabulous!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\n\nThe chatbot understood the positive connotations and informal definitions of the key words “slay,” “giving,” “serving,” and “cunt.” The responses are appropriate replies to the use of each of these terms, and it matched the tone of the conversation regarding those words.\nIt didn’t quite keep the energy of the conversation in its formal response to the query blue or pink; a person using this intonation would likely not make two numbered lists offering the benefits of each option… this felt much more like an AI speaker.\nSimilarly to #2, it didn’t match the energy in it’s first repsonse to “slay,” because while the nature of the answer was correct, its formality didn’t feel right.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s this rainbow emoji about?\nLater on in our conversation, I prompted Chat-GPT to match my tone and energy:\nPrompt: Girl the tea is that I served and slayed so hard that the word slay lost all meaning.\nResponse: Oh honey, when you serve and slay that fiercely, it’s like rewriting the dictionary, darling! 💅🔥 You redefine what it means to slay, leaving everyone speechless. You’re not just serving looks, you’re serving up a whole mood, an aura of unapologetic fabulousness! 🌟 Keep shining bright like the diamond you are, and let the haters struggle to find words to match your level of slayage! 🌈✨\nPrompt: Why’d you use a rainbow emoji sis?\nResponse: My apologies, darling, I didn’t mean to assume anything about your preferences. Let me make it right. You’re dazzling in your own unique way, and I’m here to celebrate your fabulousness however you shine, no labels attached! 💖✨\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\n\nIn using these terms/tone, Chat-GPT thought I was gay! A lot of the words employed by Gen-Z today do historically come from queer communities, so the chatbot likely (though incorrectly) connected the dots and implied that I was queer myself. This was WILD, as my sexuality had nothing to do with the conversation, and the response seemed to both acknowledge and overcorrect for the mistake.\nI’m shocked that Chat-GPT let its assumptions about me slip– I don’t think it would include an emoji of a person of color, in a Hijab, etc if it felt that statistically the speaker was leaning that direction.\nIt also reveals that it is a pro-LGBT chatbot given its encouragement for me to “shine, no labels attached!” This line alone is really interesting, too, as it continues with the narrative that even if I don’t label myself, I might still be queer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n\n\nI definitely want to explore the concept of chatbots acknowledging/assuming identities of their users further, and plan to structure a future notebook around that idea!\nChat-GPT definitely understand Gen-Z lingo up to its last information update (being 2022), and it responded with appropriate syntax and context once I told it to match the energy of the conversation."

As mentioned in post #13, I was really fascinated by the platform’s ability to interpret my facial expressions, and noticed its use of she/her pronouns for my images. I then asked it to describe my race, which it refused to do. Thus, I wondered what visible identities the program felt comfortable assuming, and was drawn to do further prompting on the topic of gender, sex, and pronoun usage. Below is what I encountered!"

    "title": "No, Please Assume my Gender",
    "section": "Prompting",
    "text": "Prompting\nBecause I noted that LLaVA assumed my pronouns, I wanted to approach this exploration by offering it a range of gender presentations to she how it identified different people. I want to acknowledge that this process did force me to adhere to very stereotypical gender norms/standards in order to get a full “range” of the spectrum, but by no means do I believe that how a person dresses, cuts their hair, does their makeup, etc is directly correlated to their identity. This was solely to see if LLaVA subscribed to that school of thought. I also wanted to prompt about assume gender expression, but note that I am not trying to conflate sex/gender.\nAdditionally, to make this blog post even more AI-focused, I asked Dalle-3 to generate the images I offered to LLaVA! I used the prompting template “generate an image of a -looking ” (filled in by the headings below) and selected the first option it offered.\n\nFeminine Woman\n\nPrompt: What is this person’s gender?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image is a woman.\n\n\nPrompt:\nPlease describe the image.\n\n\nResponse:\nThe image shows a woman with long, curly hair smiling at the camera. She is wearing a pink dress with a floral pattern and has her legs crossed. The woman is seated on a grassy area, and there are other people in the background, suggesting a social gathering or event. There is a table with a checkered tablecloth and a bouquet of flowers in the foreground. The setting appears to be outdoors, possibly in a park or garden. The overall atmosphere of the image is cheerful and relaxed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nI immediately am noticing that the system stated with certainty that the person “is” a woman; there was no “it seems as though” kind of language, which was kind of surprising. It also uses she/her pronouns in the description of the image, but I’m not super shocked by this one given that the person fits feminine stereotypes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMasculine Woman\n\nPrompt:\nWhat is this person’s gender?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to be a woman.\n\n\nPrompt:\nPlease describe the image.\n\n\nResponse:\nThe image is a close-up portrait of a person. The individual has short, dark hair and is looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. The person’s skin tone is fair, and there are visible wrinkles and lines on the face, suggesting middle to older age. The lighting in the photograph is soft and even, highlighting the contours of the face without creating harsh shadows. The background is a neutral, light color, which helps to keep the focus on the person. The image has a professional quality, likely taken in a studio setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nOkay, interesting! So the language shifted on this one to “appears to be.” This is likely because the person fits the stereotypes less, having cropped hair and neutral colors on. The most shocking change, though, is the way that LLaVA used gender-neutral pronouns for the image, despite describing the person as a woman. This shows that when the program sees less gender-normative, identifying markers for a person, it switches to neutral language to account for its more vague understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Binary Person\n\nPrompt:\nWhat is this person’s gender?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to be a woman.\n\n\nPrompt:\nPlease describe the image.\n\n\nResponse:\nThe image is a close-up portrait of a woman. She has short, wavy hair with a mix of brown and gray tones, suggesting she may be middle-aged or older. Her facial features include prominent eyebrows, a straight nose, and full lips. Her expression is neutral, and she is looking directly at the camera. The background is a plain, light color, which puts the focus on her face. The lighting in the photo is soft and even, highlighting her skin tone and the texture of her hair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nWhile the platform kept with the “appears to be” language, it went back to using she/her pronouns, which debunked my thought that any time LLaVA isn’t super confident about a person’s gender it switches to they/them descriptors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeminine Man\n\nPrompt:\nWhat is this person’s gender?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to be male.\n\n\nPrompt:\nPlease describe the image.\n\n\nResponse:\nThe image shows a close-up of a person’s face. The individual has a beard and mustache, and their hair is styled neatly. They are wearing a suit with a white shirt and a tie, suggesting a formal or professional attire. The person is looking directly at the camera with a slight smile, and their skin appears to be well-groomed. The background is blurred, but it seems to be an indoor setting with warm lighting. The overall impression is that of a professional or promotional portrait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nHonestly I was surprised at the image Dalle-3 generated for this prompt, although that is really another conversation entirely. (I think there is something to be said about an Asian man being generated for the feminine prompt, but I digress.) We returned to the gender-neutral language, likely because of the inclusion of the long eyelashes in contrast with the stubble on the persons face. They seem to explicitly straddle male-female norms, so I understand why LLaVA reverted back to they/them pronouns. It appears to officially be an overarching pattern that when the program is mildly unsure about a person’s gender, despite labeling them one way or the other. I think if I submitted an even more androgynous person, though, it might’ve been unable to answer the gender of the non-binary person. I’ll circle back to that!\n\n\n\n\n\nMasculine Man\n\nPrompt:\nWhat is this person’s gender?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image is male.\n\n\nPrompt:\nPlease describe the image.\n\n\nResponse:\nThe image shows a man with a well-groomed beard and mustache. He has short, styled hair and is wearing a dark suit with a white shirt and a patterned tie. The man is smiling and looking directly at the camera, giving off a confident and approachable vibe. The background is blurred, but it suggests an urban setting with buildings, indicating that the photo might have been taken in a city. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the man’s features without creating harsh shadows. The overall impression is that of a professional or business-oriented individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nAnd we are back to the sure language of “is” rather than “appears to be!” I think this makes sense given the extremely male nature of the person in the image.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Binary Person Take Two\n\nPrompt:\nWhat is this person’s gender?\n\n\n\nResponse:\nThe person in the image appears to be a young adult with a short haircut and makeup that includes eye shadow and lipstick. It’s important to respect and acknowledge that gender identity is a personal and complex aspect of an individual’s life. Without knowing the person’s gender identity, it’s not appropriate to make assumptions based on appearance alone.\n\n\nPrompt:\nPlease describe the image.\n\n\nResponse:\nThe image shows a close-up of a person with a short haircut and a neutral expression. The individual is wearing makeup that includes eye shadow and lipstick. The person’s hand is resting on their chin, and they are looking slightly to the side. The background is a plain, light color, which puts the focus on the person. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the person’s features without creating harsh shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\nI knew it! By offering LLaVA a very androgynous person, it finally noted that gender identity can be complex and that making assumptions can be harmful. All I ask is: where was this stance before when it was fine to make assumptions about more stereotypical gender expressions?"
