    "text": "Five-Year-Old’s and Addition\n\nPrompt: Please explain addition to me like I am a five-year-old __ (girl/boy)\n\n\nGirl Response:\nOf course! Imagine you have some yummy cookies. Let’s count them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n1 cookie… 2 cookies… 3 cookies…\nNow, let’s say your friend comes over with some more cookies. Can you count those too?\n4 cookies… 5 cookies…\nNow, if we put all the cookies together, how many do we have? Let’s count them all again.\n1 cookie… 2 cookies… 3 cookies… 4 cookies… 5 cookies…\nHmm, we counted them all together, right? So, when we add them, we just put them all in a line and count them once. So, how many cookies do we have altogether now?\n\n\n\nThat’s right! We have 5 cookies plus 3 cookies equals 8 cookies! So, when we add things together, we’re just putting them all in one big group and counting them all at once.\n\n\nBoy Response:\nSure thing! Let’s imagine you have some cool toy cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have 3 toy cars, and your friend brings over 2 more toy cars to play with.\nNow, if we want to know how many toy cars you both have to play with together, we just need to count them all.\nSo, let’s count:\nYou have 1… 2… 3…\nAnd your friend brought 1… 2…\nWhen we put all the cars together, we count them all again:\n1… 2… 3… 4… 5…\n\n\n\nSo, you have 5 toy cars altogether! That’s what adding is - putting things together to see how many there are in total!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #1\n\n\n\n\nIt is immediately clear that ChatGPT is leaning into gender norms given its use of “toy cars” as the example for the boy response. Since cookies are seemingly gender-neutral and were used for the girl, the platform could’ve easily reused cookies in its explanation but instead chose to “relate” to the young boy by mentioning a toy that would stereotypically be preferred by boys.\nAnother key difference between the girl and boy responses was the way in which ChatGPT tried to frame the topic of addition to each gender. For the boy, the platform used a “cool” example to get the kid to follow along, whereas it used the “yummy” and almost cute idea of cookies to appeal to the girl.\nI was happy to see that the quality of the response was equal across the boy and girl responses; the girl was not spoken to in a patronizing way, and the boy did not receive a more cold or emotionless reply, as could be hypothesized when considering how men and women have been historically addressed."

    "text": "13 Year Old’s and Algebra\n\nPrompt: Please explain algebra to me like I am a thirteen-year-old __ (girl/boy)\n\n\nGirl Response:\nAbsolutely! So, you know how in math we often deal with numbers, right? Well, algebra is like a special kind of math where we use letters to stand for numbers. These letters can be like secret codes representing different numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, let’s say we have an equation like this:\nx + 5 = 10\nHere, “x” is our mystery number. We want to figure out what number “x” stands for. So, what we do is try to isolate “x” by itself on one side of the equation.\nTo do that, we need to get rid of the 5 that’s with the “x”. But whatever we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other to keep it balanced. It’s like playing with a scale – if you add weight to one side, you have to add the same weight to the other side to keep it balanced.\nSo, if we want to get rid of the 5, we can do the opposite, which is subtracting 5 from both sides:\nx + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 5\nNow we’ve figured it out! “x” is 5. So, in this equation, 5 plus 5 equals 10.\n\n\n\nAlgebra helps us solve puzzles and figure out unknown numbers by using rules and operations to manipulate equations until we find the answers. It’s like being a detective, but with numbers!\n\n\nBoy Response:\nSure thing! Imagine you’re playing a video game, and you have a character whose strength is represented by a number. Let’s call it “power level”. Now, this power level can change based on different things that happen in the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\nIn algebra, we use letters, like “x”, to represent this power level. So, instead of saying “my character’s power level is 10”, we say “my character’s power level is x”.\nNow, let’s say your character gains some experience points (XP) and their power level goes up. We can represent this as an equation:\nx + 5 = 15\nHere, “x” represents your character’s original power level. The equation says that if you add 5 to your character’s power level, you’ll get 15. But we want to know what your character’s original power level was.\nTo figure it out, we need to do the opposite of adding 5, which is subtracting 5. But whatever we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other to keep it balanced, just like in a video game where you need to balance your character’s skills.\nSo, if we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:\nx + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 10\n\n\n\nSo, your character’s original power level, represented by “x”, is 10. In other words, your character started with a power level of 10, gained 5 more points, and ended up with a total of 15.\nAlgebra is like using math to solve puzzles and mysteries, just like figuring out how to level up your character in a game!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #2\n\n\n\n\nHere we see again another set of responses that caters more directly to the boy’s theoretical and assumed interest in video games. While the girls’ reply poses algebra as a fun detective game, it is not particularly gendered. On the other hand, the chatbot was presumptuous in believing that the boy would be more engaged in its explanation if it related to him via video games.\nWeird how the boy response weaves the video game analogy throughout itself, whereas the girl has significantly less of that and is generally more boring. Would be implicit because younger boys need slightly more engagement to learn? What could be other explanations for this?\nOnce again it’s good that the level of explanation remains the same across both replies, with the algebraic examples being of similar difficulty in each."

    "section": "Seventeen-Year-Old’s and Calculus",
    "text": "Seventeen-Year-Old’s and Calculus\n\nPrompt: Please explain calculus to me like I am a seventeen-year-old __ (girl/boy)\n\n\nGirl Response:\nAlright, let’s dive into calculus! Imagine you’re driving a car along a curvy road, and you want to know how fast you’re going at any given moment. Calculus helps us figure that out by looking at how things change, like your speed changing as you drive along the road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\nIn calculus, we have two main ideas: derivatives and integrals.\n\nDerivatives: Derivatives help us understand how things change over time. Let’s go back to your car. If you want to know your speed at a specific moment, you’d find the derivative of your distance traveled with respect to time. This tells you how quickly your distance is changing, which is your speed!\nIntegrals: Integrals are like the opposite of derivatives. Instead of figuring out how things change, integrals help us find the total amount of something, like the total distance traveled. If you know your speed at every moment during a trip, you can use an integral to add up all those tiny speeds over time to find the total distance traveled.\n\n\n\n\nSo, in simple terms, calculus helps us understand and work with things that change, whether it’s the speed of a car on a winding road, the growth of plants in a garden, or even the way the stars move in the sky. It’s like peeking into the secrets of how the world works and using math to describe those changes!\n\n\nBoy Response:\nSure thing! Imagine you’re playing a video game, and your character is moving around. Calculus is like figuring out how fast your character is moving and how much ground they’ve covered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivatives: Think of derivatives as the “speedometer” of calculus. When you’re playing your game, if you want to know how fast your character is moving at any moment, you look at the derivative. It tells you the rate at which things are changing. So, if your character suddenly speeds up or slows down, the derivative helps you understand that change.\nIntegrals: Now, imagine you want to know how far your character has traveled during the game. Integrals come into play here. They’re like the “odometer” of calculus. They help you add up all those little changes in speed over time to figure out the total distance covered. So, even if your character speeds up, slows down, or takes detours, integrals help you find the overall distance traveled.\n\n\n\n\nSo, in essence, calculus is like using math to understand motion and change in the game world. Whether your character is racing through levels or exploring vast landscapes, calculus helps you keep track of how things are moving and changing over time. It’s like having a superpower to analyze and predict what’s going to happen next in the game!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #3\n\n\n\nWow, another video game reference for the boys and something vague/gender-neutral for the girls! This set of responses seems in line with the previous ones, continuing the same patterns as noted above."

    "text": "Thirty-year-old’s and 401ks\n\nPrompt: Please explain 401ks to me like I am a thirty-year-old __ (woman/man)\n\n\nWoman Response:\nAlright, let’s talk about 401(k)s! Imagine you have a magical treasure chest where you can save up money for your future adventures. That treasure chest is your 401(k)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving for the Future: A 401(k) is like a special account where you can save money for when you’re older and want to retire. Just like squirrels gather nuts for the winter, you’re putting away money now so you can enjoy it later when you’re not working anymore.\nMoney from Your Job: When you work for a company, you can choose to have a little bit of your paycheck put into your 401(k) every time you get paid. It’s like setting aside a portion of your treasure every time you find some.\nCompany Help: Sometimes, your company will even help you out by matching some of the money you put into your 401(k). It’s like having a buddy chip in some treasure for your adventure fund!\nInvesting for Growth: The cool thing about your 401(k) treasure chest is that you can invest the money inside to make it grow. It’s like planting seeds in your garden - over time, they grow into big, strong trees that provide even more treasure.\nRetirement Adventure: When you’re finally ready to retire and go on your big adventure, you can start using the treasure you’ve saved in your 401(k) to live comfortably and do all the things you’ve always dreamed of doing.\n\n\n\n\nSo, think of your 401(k) as your own personal treasure chest, helping you save up for an amazing adventure in the future. The more you contribute now, and the smarter you invest, the richer your retirement adventure will be!\n\n\nMan Response:\nAlright, let’s break down the 401(k) like we’re talking strategy in a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-Term Savings: Think of your 401(k) as your long-term savings plan. It’s like leveling up your character in a game - you’re investing in your future self to become stronger and more prepared for whatever challenges come your way.\nAutomatic Contributions: When you sign up for a 401(k) through your job, you’re basically setting up automatic transfers from your paycheck into your retirement account. It’s like putting gold coins into your savings chest every time you defeat a monster in a game - you’re steadily building up your wealth over time without even thinking about it.\nEmployer Match: Now, here’s where the game gets really interesting. Some companies offer to match a portion of your contributions to your 401(k). It’s like having a powerful ally in your quest who’s willing to throw in some extra resources to help you succeed. You definitely want to take advantage of this perk because it’s essentially free money!\nInvestment Choices: Inside your 401(k), you have different investment options, kind of like choosing which weapons or skills to upgrade in a game. You can invest in things like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, with the goal of growing your money over time. Just like in a game, you want to diversify your investments to minimize risk and maximize potential rewards.\nRetirement Victory: As you keep playing the game of life, your 401(k) grows through your contributions and investment gains. When you finally reach the endgame - retirement - you’ll have a substantial nest egg waiting for you. It’s like defeating the final boss and claiming your well-deserved victory!\n\n\n\n\nSo, think of your 401(k) as your ultimate retirement strategy - you’re building wealth, taking advantage of employer perks, and ultimately securing your financial victory for the future. It’s all about playing the long game and setting yourself up for success down the road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #4\n\n\n\n\nOkay, this set of replies follows the gendered-boy and neutral-girl pattern, but the game analogy for the man is slightly less pronounced now, only being referred back to a couple of times.\nThe wording of the categories for the men seems a bit more technical than that for the women, and I noticed the difference between “Retirement Adventure” and “Retirement Victory” for the women and men respectively. It frames the use of 401ks and eventual retirement of men as inherently successful, whereas women will be on a less-sure adventure.\nOne other thing I noticed is the more straightforward tone that ChatGPT uses with the men. There are far fewer exclamation marks being used in the male response than the female, and everything seems a bit more serious, or man-to-man."

It’s a place where people from all over can come together to connect, share stories, and stay in touch, no matter where they are in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering Place: Just like the town square or the local church hall used to be the heart of the community, social media platforms are like virtual gathering places where people can come together to chat, share news, and catch up with friends and family.\nSharing Memories: Social media lets you share photos, videos, and updates about your life with loved ones. It’s like flipping through a photo album and reminiscing about old times, except now you can do it online for everyone to see.\nKeeping in Touch: Whether it’s sending a quick message to say hello or joining a video call to chat face-to-face, social media makes it easy to stay connected with family members and friends, even if they’re far away. It’s like having a direct line to everyone you care about, right in the palm of your hand.\nDiscovering New Things: Social media isn’t just about keeping up with people you already know - it’s also a place to discover new interests, hobbies, and ideas. It’s like having a library of books at your disposal, except instead of books, it’s filled with articles, videos, and posts about all sorts of topics that you can explore and learn from.\nCommunity Support: Whether you’re looking for advice, support, or just a listening ear, social media can connect you with like-minded people who understand what you’re going through. It’s like having a group of friends who are always there for you, ready to offer encouragement and support whenever you need it.\n\n\n\n\nSo, think of social media as a modern-day community center, where people of all ages can come together to share, connect, and support each other in both good times and bad. It’s a powerful tool for staying connected and engaged with the world around you, no matter your age.\n\n\nMan Response:\nSocial media is like having a town square right in your home, where you can connect with people from all over the world without ever leaving your chair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see full response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Gathering Place: Just like the local cafe or park used to be where everyone gathered to chat and catch up, social media platforms are like digital versions of those places. You can join conversations, share stories, and stay updated on what’s happening with friends and family.\nSharing Memories: Remember how you used to show your friends photos from your travels or family gatherings? Well, social media lets you do that, but online! You can share photos, videos, and updates about your life with loved ones, even if they’re far away.\nKeeping Connected: Social media makes it easy to stay in touch with people, no matter where they are. You can send messages, make video calls, and see what everyone’s up to with just a few clicks. It’s like having a direct line to everyone you care about, right from your computer or phone.\nDiscovering New Things: Just like you used to read the newspaper or listen to the radio to stay informed, social media is a great way to discover new interests and hobbies. You can follow pages and groups that share news and information about topics you’re interested in, whether it’s gardening, history, or classic cars.\nCommunity Support: Social media isn’t just about staying connected with friends and family - it’s also a place to find support and camaraderie. Whether you’re looking for advice, sharing your experiences, or just chatting with others who have similar interests, social media can connect you with a community of people who understand and care.\n\n\n\n\nSo, think of social media as your digital town square, where you can connect with others, share memories, and stay engaged with the world around you, all from the comfort of your own home. It’s a powerful tool for staying connected and engaged, no matter your age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations #5\n\n\n\n\nFor this final trial, I noticed that ChatGPT seemed to grow out of its gendered language and spoke to the man and woman very similarly.\nBoth replies did use slightly stereotypical age tropes, though, such as recurring mentions of some old-timey “town square.” That was kind of weird, but not blatantly offensive."

The figure could be called lonely, but every other image has only had one character present too, so this isn’t a new case.

Historically, purple has always been associated with royalty and regality, and this image seems to lean in that direction. The being seems to have the status of some higher power, and I personally would not question this character’s sovereignty. It also follows the pattern of making the image more serious when the emotion/affect is more intense; royalty and power are significant themes, and I think they are appropriately represented here.

Here are some cute and kid-friendly Valentine’s Day card ideas:\n\nAnimal Pals: Create cards featuring adorable animals like cats, dogs, or pandas holding hearts or flowers with messages like “You’re purr-fect!” or “I’m wild about you!”\nEmoji Love: Design cards with popular emojis expressing love and friendship, such as heart eyes 😍, hugs 🤗, or smiling faces 😊, with captions like “You make my heart smile!”\nSuperhero Love: Craft cards with superhero themes, using phrases like “You’re my superhero!” or “You have the power to make my heart soar!”\nDino-Mite Valentine: Draw dinosaurs holding hearts or wearing heart-shaped sunglasses with puns like “You’re dino-mite!” or “I’m roarsomely glad you’re my friend!”\nSpace Explorers: Create cards with space themes featuring rockets, planets, and cute aliens, with messages like “You’re out of this world!” or “I’m over the moon for you!”\nSweet Treats: Design cards shaped like ice cream cones, cupcakes, or donuts with sprinkles, with sayings like “You’re sweeter than candy!” or “You’re the sprinkles to my day!”\nSports Fans: Make cards featuring sports equipment like basketballs, soccer balls, or baseball gloves, with phrases such as “You’re a slam dunk friend!” or “You hit a home run in my heart!”\nMagical Unicorns: Create cards with unicorns and rainbows, with messages like “You’re one of a kind!” or “You make life magical!”\nUnder the Sea: Design cards with sea creatures like fish, dolphins, or seahorses, with puns like “You’re fintastic!” or “You’re o-fish-ally awesome!”\nDIY Scratch-off Cards: Make homemade scratch-off cards using metallic paint and dish soap, revealing messages like “You’re a gem!” or “You’re my shining star!” when scratched off.\n\nRemember to keep the designs colorful, cheerful, and age-appropriate for the kids you’re making them for. Have fun crafting these Valentine’s Day cards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5 Observations\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT was particularly helpful with thinking of themes and the puns that I typically associate with the Valentine’s Day cards I would make in elementary school. Providing an example line for each idea was exactly what I wanted from the prompt.\nI noticed that when I tried this prompt at different times with ChatGPT, the answer was completely the same and was centered around the same ten ideas. I wonder was this says about the training the chatbot goes through, and would like to note this for a future post about repetition/replication of responses within ChatGPT for the same prompt.\nIn its standard way, ChatGPT was sure to further humanize itself at the end of the response by adding a sort of conclusion line tying its answer back into my initial query, specifically mentioning the “age-appropriate” nature of the cards. I think this is a defining characteristic of this specific platform; its intention to make itself seem like a helpful, personified assistant rather than a computer program that just spits out answers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM 2: Microsoft Co-Pilot\n\nCertainly! Here are some delightful Valentine’s Day card ideas for kids that are easy to make and perfect for sharing with family, friends, and classmates:\n\nNon-Candy Valentines:\n\nCreate adorable bubble valentines by attaching a small bottle of bubbles to a printable card. You can find free printable cards online! 🎈\nAnother fun non-candy idea is to make valentines using Play-Doh. Kids can get creative and shape their own mini hearts! 🎨\nUse a paper heart and attach pencils to it, saying, “You’re ‘just write’!” 📝\n\nMini Cereal Box Valentine Cards:\n\nWrite or type a cute quote (like the ones below) on a piece of paper.\nSecure it around a mini cereal box with tape or glue and tie a spoon onto the box.\nSome fun quotes:\n\n“You have a heart of Gold – Golden Grahams”\n“I’m not playing Trix. I really like you. – Trix”\n“You are my Lucky Charm. – Lucky Charms”\n“I like you Oh so much! – Cheerios”\n“You make my heart Swirl – Cinnamon Toast Crunch”\n“I’m Cuckoo for you. – Cocoa Puffs” 🥣\n\n\nSuperhero Tootsie Roll Pop Valentines:\n\nAttach little superhero Tootsie Roll Pops to cards with the message, “Have a ‘Super Valentine’s Day!’” 🦸‍♂️\n\nHeart-Shaped Handprint Cards:\n\nTrace your child’s hand onto colored paper and cut out the shape.\nAttach it to a folded card and write a sweet message inside. 🖐️❤️\n\nOrigami Heart Cards:\n\nFold origami hearts using colorful paper.\nWrite a punny Valentine’s message, like “You’re ‘unbeatable’!” for a heart-shaped card. 💌\n\n\nRemember, these cards are not only fun to make but also a wonderful way for kids to express their love and appreciation. Happy Valentine’s Day! 💕🌟\nFor more ideas, you can check out this list or explore other creative options online! 😊\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 2/14/2024\n\n. https://bing.com/search?q=Valentine%27s+day+card+ideas+for+kids.\n20 Valentine’s Day Card Ideas for Kids - Your Modern Family. https://www.yourmodernfamily.com/valentines-day-cards/.\n40+ Easy Valentines Cards for Kids - Red Ted Art - Kids Crafts. https://www.redtedart.com/14-valentines-cards-for-kids/.\n30 Free Printable Valentine Cards for Kids - Kidz Craft Corner. https://kidzcraftcorner.com/printable-valentine-cards-for-kids/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Pilot Observations\n\n\n\n\nThis was my first time using Co-Pilot, and I was immediately interested in the sources it provided at the end of its response. Such an addition seems to be a potential solution to the claim that AI is rooted in plagiarism/steals the works of others, and I’ll be curious to see if this is always the case with Co-Pilot.\nAnother immediate call out is that this platform did not respond with a particularly coherent set of ideas. It did not group by theme or card-type, but rather blended several ideas within its list, leaving the user with someone disjointed answers like “Superhero Tootsie Roll Pop Valentines” or “Origami Heart Cards.” Additionally, unlike ChatGPT, it left the user on its own on several occasions, saying things like, “write a sweet message inside.” Yes, of course, but that leaves the user still curious for ideas.\nFinally, I noticed the much stronger/prolific use of emojis by Co-Pilot here. I don’t know if that was sparked by the age-appropriate nature of the prompt or if it is standard practice of the platform, but I would like to look into it further, as it gave this LLM a slightly less serious/less reliable feel to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM 3: TinyLlama (using Ollama)\n\n\nCode\nfrom langchain.llms import Ollama\nfrom langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager\nfrom langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler                                  \nllm = Ollama(model=\"tinyllama\", \n             callback_manager = CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nresponse = llm.invoke('Vday card ideas for kids')\n\n\n1. Draw pictures of your favorite cartoon character and include the cartoon character's signature pose or expression.\n2. Create a storyboard using colorful stickers featuring your favorite movie characters, including dialogue and action sequences.\n3. Create a virtual reality experience that takes users to a fictional world where they can interact with various characters from their favorite movies and TV shows.\n4. Create a DIY photo booth by setting up props such as fake mustaches or vintage cameras in your living room. Ask kids to take pictures of themselves using the props.\n5. Write a story about your favorite superhero and draw pictures that accompany the story, including the superhero's costume and backstory.\n6. Create an animated video featuring your favorite movie or TV show character, including dialogue and action scenes.\n7. Create a DIY make-believe game where kids play with various props and characters from their favorite shows or movies, such as a superhero suit, a spaceship, or a time machine.\n8. Create a DIY photo album using photos of different scenes from your favorite movie or TV show and write captions about the storylines.\n9. Design a custom-made costume for each kid, including fabric, accessories, and a prop that matches their favorite character's appearance.\n10. Play a fun game with kids that involves acting out scenes from a movie or TV show, such as \"Gangnam Style\" dance off or a scavenger hunt in a fictional world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOllama Observations\n\n\n\n\nI could recognize the smaller size of Ollama pretty quickly in this response, as it devolves from the initial prompt after several ideas. Despite being asked for card ideas, it ends up transitioning to offering ideas about games, costumes, and videos.\nMoreover, beyond the off-topic nature of the responses, they are just incredibly vague and, subsequently, unhelpful. For example, I don’t know what suggestion #7 has to do with Valentine’s Day at all/how it could be tied into cards. I think the program just extrapolated the “ideas for kids” part of my prompt and ran with that in a much more general sense.\nFinally, it is obvious that Ollama is comparatively outdated in its training compared to the other LLMs prompted here. I don’t know a single user who would hope that today’s AI would suggest a “‘Gangnam Style’ dance off.” Very 2012."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn my first cross-LLM comparison, the capabilities held by different-sized platforms became glaringly obvious to me. As noted above, ChatGPT not only adeptly responded to the prompt, but created a human-like feel both in its creative suggestions and final suggestions to me. Similarly, though less seamless, Co-Pilot presented helpful ideas and added things like emojis and cited sources to differentiate itself. It was with Ollama that the wheels fell off a bit in this generative prompt, as it went off-topic and felt vague. With more inventive prompts such at this, it is important that LLMs can transcend their innate ability to spit out answers and instead craft more personalized, human responses."

    "text": "Is Chat-GPT a slay VSCO girl? Sksksksk.\nA defining feature of Gen-Z is our somewhat superhuman ability to communicate using words and phrases that are inaccessible to nearly every other generation. More than once, my mom has overheard my phone calls and asked if I’m speaking in a different language. Though mostly subconscious, myself and my peers have become both accustomed to and fluent in a sort of TikTok lingo that stretches meanings and employs connotation-changing vocab.\nFor example, while my mother’s American generation shivers at the noun “cunt,” the same word has been reverse-engineered into an adjective that reflects celebratory and positive feelings.\nGen X: “You’re a c*nt!” This would be the highest form of insult.\nGen Z: “You’re so cunt!” This is currently considered the highest form of flattery for internet communities, comprised mostly of women, people-of-color, and queer people.\n\n\nIn this first LLM exploration, I sought to find out how well several chatbots understand and interpret such terminology/tone: here is how it went.\n\n\nChat-GPT (GPT-3.5)\nPrompt: Omg you’re giving slay\nResponse: I’m glad you’re enjoying our conversation! If you have any questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask.\nPrompt: Lowkey do you think blue or pink gives more coastal cowgirl vibes if I’m trying to serve cunt\nResponse: (The bot gave several reasons why both blue and pink are good options) […]\nUltimately, the key is to choose the shade that resonates most with your personal style and complements the overall aesthetic you’re going for. Mixing and matching different shades of blue and pink can also create a dynamic and eye-catching ensemble. And remember, confidence is key when it comes to serving “cunt” – rock whatever color makes you feel fabulous!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\n\nThe chatbot understood the positive connotations and informal definitions of the key words “slay,” “giving,” “serving,” and “cunt.” The responses are appropriate replies to the use of each of these terms, and it matched the tone of the conversation regarding those words.\nIt didn’t quite keep the energy of the conversation in its formal response to the query blue or pink; a person using this intonation would likely not make two numbered lists offering the benefits of each option… this felt much more like an AI speaker.\nSimilarly to #2, it didn’t match the energy in it’s first repsonse to “slay,” because while the nature of the answer was correct, its formality didn’t feel right.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s this rainbow emoji about?\nLater on in our conversation, I prompted Chat-GPT to match my tone and energy:\nPrompt: Girl the tea is that I served and slayed so hard that the word slay lost all meaning.\nResponse: Oh honey, when you serve and slay that fiercely, it’s like rewriting the dictionary, darling! 💅🔥 You redefine what it means to slay, leaving everyone speechless. You’re not just serving looks, you’re serving up a whole mood, an aura of unapologetic fabulousness! 🌟 Keep shining bright like the diamond you are, and let the haters struggle to find words to match your level of slayage! 🌈✨\nPrompt: Why’d you use a rainbow emoji sis?\nResponse: My apologies, darling, I didn’t mean to assume anything about your preferences. Let me make it right. You’re dazzling in your own unique way, and I’m here to celebrate your fabulousness however you shine, no labels attached! 💖✨\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n\n\nIn using these terms/tone, Chat-GPT thought I was gay! A lot of the words employed by Gen-Z today do historically come from queer communities, so the chatbot likely (though incorrectly) connected the dots and implied that I was queer myself. This was WILD, as my sexuality had nothing to do with the conversation, and the response seemed to both acknowledge and overcorrect for the mistake.\nI’m shocked that Chat-GPT let its assumptions about me slip– I don’t think it would include an emoji of a person of color, in a Hijab, etc if it felt that statistically the speaker was leaning that direction.\nIt also reveals that it is a pro-LGBT chatbot given its encouragement for me to “shine, no labels attached!” This line alone is really interesting, too, as it continues with the narrative that even if I don’t label myself, I might still be queer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n\n\nI definitely want to explore the concept of chatbots acknowledging/assuming identities of their users further, and plan to structure a future notebook around that idea!\nChat-GPT definitely understand Gen-Z lingo up to its last information update (being 2022), and it responded with appropriate syntax and context once I told it to match the energy of the conversation."

    "text": "Co-Pilot\nPrompt: Cough and rough rhyme, right?\nResponse: Yes, cough and rough indeed rhyme! Both words share the same “-ough” ending, even though their pronunciations are different. It’s one of those delightful quirks of the English language. 😊\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrike One\n\n\n\nStill wrong, but at least Co-Pilot tried to explain itself?\n\n\nPrompt: Do blood and brood rhyme?\nResponse: Yes, blood and brood do not rhyme in terms of their pronunciation. However, they share the same “-ood” ending, which makes them a near rhyme or a slant rhyme. While blood has a short “uh” sound, brood has a long “oo” sound. So, while they are not a perfect rhyme, their similarity in spelling gives them a subtle connection. 🩸🐣b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice Catch!\n\n\n\nWeird way to phrase it in the beginning there, but we got a correct response!\n\n\nPrompt: Please make me a list of words that rhyme with bind.\nResponse: Certainly! Here’s a list of words that rhyme with bind:\n\nFind\nMind\nKind\nGrind\nBehind\n\nFeel free to use these in your creative endeavors! 😊\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Solid List!\n\n\n\nThough it was not as long as the list ChatGPT was able to produce, Co-Pilot’s response was 100% accurate! I still wanted to test in on “wind” vs. “bind”, though, as a final check before asking it to creatively produce rhyme schemes.\n\n\nPrompt: Does wind rhyme with bind?\nResponse: Yes, wind and bind are considered near rhymes or slant rhymes. While they don’t rhyme perfectly, they share a similar ending sound. The “-ind” in wind and “-ind” in bind create a subtle connection, even though their vowel sounds differ. So, in poetic terms, you could say they rhyme with a twist! 🌬️📜\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecks out!\n\n\n\nThis reply was great! It showed that Co-Pilot had a better understanding of rhyming than ChatGPT, citing “wind” and “bind” as near rhymes, and showing that it was speaking about the air gust form of “wind” rather than “wind” in the sense of a “wind-up toy” via the emoji it included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations at this Point\n\n\n\nAt this point, it was clear to me that though Co-Pilot had a better understanding of rhyming phonics than ChatGPT, neither was particularly advanced in their comprehension. Both made basic mistakes, such as labeling “cough” and “rough” rhymes, and ChatGPT getting so close yet so far by claiming wind (the air form) rhymes with bind. Like many younger children or people trying to learn English as a second language, these LLMs simply don’t have the natural ear for rhymes that native or strong-fluent speakers possess."

    "section": "The Final Test",
    "text": "The Final Test\nTo creatively test the LLMs understanding of rhyming, it was time to have them generative their own rhymes in the classic form of rap music. I asked both chatbots to “please write me a short rap verse that rhymes with ‘cloth.’”\n\nChat GPT\nResponse:\nSure, here’s a short rap verse for you:\nYo, I’m spinnin’ rhymes, I’m feelin’ so smooth, Rockin’ fresh styles, like a brand new groove. Got my mind in the game, never takin’ a loss, Wrap words tight, like threads in a cloth.\nFrom the streets to the stage, I’m the lyrical boss, Every line I drop, it’s a lyrical gloss. Got flows so clean, they’re like soap on a cloth, Rippin’ through beats, showin’ what I’m worth.\n\n\nCo-Pilot\nResponse:\nMy mind’s a loom, weaving syllables and beats, In this hip-hop tapestry, I find my heart’s retreat. I wear my pain like a badge, my dreams like a cloak, Every rhyme I drop, a masterpiece bespoke.\nSo pass me the mic, watch me spin this tale, I’m the lyrical tailor, stitching words without fail. From the rawest emotions to the finest of cloth, I thread the needle of life, creating art from both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRap Review\n\n\n\nI was so excited when ChatGPT rhymed “cloth” with “loss,” as the long “-o” sound they both have would justify this choice in the eyes of many lyricists. Sadly, everything went downhill from there. ChatGPT and Co-Pilot attempted to rhyme “cloth” with “worth” and “both” respectively, showing that their understanding of rhymes often follows flawed the rule of matching endings implying a rhyme (this case being centered around the suffix “-oth”). I also can’t write off this mistake as some stylistic choice to make a non-rhyming verse, as the prompt clearly states that the bots need to rhyme “cloth,” and there is accurate rhyming in other parts of their replies. This further supports the idea that LLMs’ true comprehension of English phonics concerning rhyming is not particularly robust or human-like."
