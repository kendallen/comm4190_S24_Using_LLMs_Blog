My name is Kendall and I am a third-year student at the University of Pennsylvania who just came back from a semester abroad in London! At Penn, I study Data & Network Science Communications, Spanish, and Consumer Psychology. Outside of the classroom, I am a Junior Captain of the Quaker Girls Dance Team, a Kite and Key Tour Guide, a member of the Wharton Women Marketing Committee, on the Executive Board of my sorority, and I do research at the Annenberg Health and Risk Communication Institute. I love to travel, see live performances, and play all of the NYT Mini Games (Letterboxed especially) in my free time.

This blog is going to focus on my exploration of Large-Language-Models within my AI class this semester. From Valentine's Day to Gen-Z slang, I will ask many different LLMs about different prompts to see how they react and refine my understanding of the programs. I hope you enjoy following along :)
